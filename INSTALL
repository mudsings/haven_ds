1) cd to the directory where all mud files reside. Called $MUDHOME
   in the rest of this document.

2) cd to v22.2b14

3) type ./build.MudOS develop

4) type: make 

5) type: make install
	If this fails, just manually copy the "driver" file
	into $MUDHOME/bin/

6) edit $MUDHOME/bin/mudos.cfg (provided). The two to change are:
mudlib directory and binary directory. For example, if your $MUDHOME
is /home/joe/mud, then the mudlib directory line will look like this:

/home/joe/mud/lib

and bin:

/home/joe/mud/bin

7) edit $MUDHOME/bin/startmud (provided) and change the $MUDHOME
    stuff.

8) manually run the mud $MUDHOME/bin/driver $MUDHOME/bin/mudos.cfg

9)  telnet to your machine, using the port specified in mudos.cfg. For
example: telnet localhost 6666

10) Create a new user. Just answer the questions. Make sure you are
the first person to log in, because that person is automatically
given admin privileges.

11) You'll get booted out. Reboot the MUD, telnet back in, and you're 
now running Your Very Own MUD.

12) If this doesn't work, please refer to the mudos.org documentation at their website. This procedure works perfectly on SuSE 9.3, SuSE 10, Solaris 8 and Solaris 10, but we can't possibly vouch for every unix flavor and compiler suite out there.

13) If there is something actually wrong with this documentation, please
visit Frontiers MUD and mudmail Cratylus. Details on this are in the
/doc/SUPPORT file.
