<p>Nothing's prefect. This is
most certainly true of anything <span style="font-style: italic;">I've</span>
touched.</p>
<p>This page contains the late-breaking bugfixes found between Dead
Souls releases. Only important bugs are addressed here. Feature
enhancements and minor bugfixes become available on full release.</p>
<p>All of the fixes listed here will be included in the next release.
They
are provided here early in order to address potential problems.</p>
<p>For Dead Souls <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">2.0r25
and below</span>,
the
following fixes are available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a <a href="http://dead-souls.net/news.html#16jun06">serious
security problem</a> that
affects all versions of Dead Souls <span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">below 2.0r26</span>. The only fix
is to apply the patch to upgrade to 2.0r26. That patch
is <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/patches/dspatch_2.0r21_2.0r26.zip">available
now</a>. This patch can be applied to any version of Dead Souls
above 2.0r20. If you plan to patch from pre- r26 to r27, you <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">must</span> reboot the mud between the
installation of the two separate patches.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>For Dead Souls <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">2.0r27</span>,
the
following fixes are available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Right as I was about to release r27, someone asked an innocent
question about bulletin boards, and I made a minor change to how they
work to address a problem. You'd think I'd have learned my lesson about
this sort of thing. The result is that bulletin boards don't work well
on 2.0r27. To fix it, copy <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/bboard.c">this file</a> over
/secure/daemon/bboard.c and <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/arch_board.c">this file</a> over
/secure/obj/arch_board.c .<br>
  </li>
</ul>
