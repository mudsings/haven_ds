<p>Nothing's prefect. This is
most certainly true of anything <span style="font-style: italic;">I've</span>
touched.</p>
<p>This page contains the late-breaking bugfixes found between Dead
Souls releases. Only important bugs are addressed here. Feature
enhancements and minor bugfixes become available on full release.</p>
<p>All of the fixes listed here will be included in the next release.
They
are provided here early in order to address potential problems.</p>
<p>For Dead Souls <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">2.0r25</span>,
the
following fixes are available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a <a href="http://dead-souls.net/news.html#16jun2006"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">serious security problem</span></a> that
affects all versions of Dead Souls. I'll be accelerating the release of
the next version, and will be trying to get a hotfix out as quickly as
possible. Until then, do not promote anyone to the position of Creator
unless you know them very very well. If you already have Creators you
don't know well, lock the mud (admintool option a) until you can
upgrade or apply the patch. Sorry, guys. I'm hoping to have it out by
Saturday, or Sunday at the latest.</li>
