<h1>QCS Described</h1>
<p>The Quick Creation System (or QCS) is a series of commands and modules that 
lets you create rooms, objects, exits, and NPCs easily and quickly. Before the 
QCS, if you wanted to make an orc, you would edit the text file by hand, or 
copy a template file and use an editor to manually change the lines you needed 
to modify. This could be a tiresome process, as the standard editor can be a bit 
awkward, and making dozens of objects this way could be real torture for 
beginners.</p>
<p>The QCS changes all of that. Rather than use an editor to modify files, the 
QCS gives you commands that permit you to modify objects on the fly. This means 
that orc creation, for example, could involve just the following simple steps 
(please note "NPC" is another word for "Mob"):</p>

<div class="inputcontainer">
<ul class="input">
   <li><span class="command">create npc new_orc</a></li>
   <li><span class="command">modify npc name orc</a></li>
   <li><span class="command">modify orc short a mean-looking orc</a></li>
   <li><span class="command">modify orc long A typical orc: nasty, brutish, and short.</a></li>
   <li><span class="command">modify orc race orc</a></li>
</ul>
</div>

<p>And that's it. All your modifications automatically get written to new_orc.c 
(usually in your area directory), and you now have an npc you can add to a room. 
Adding things to rooms is just as easy. Creating weapons, armor, and other 
objects are done the same way. For complete details and examples, read the
QCS chapters in the Creators Manual. The QCS section starts in chapter 31.</p>

<h1>Example Log</h1>
<p>Below you will find an excerpt from an short building session using
Dead Souls. This should be more or less exactly what you'll see by entering
the commands hilighted in red.</p>
