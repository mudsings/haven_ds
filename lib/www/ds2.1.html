&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead Souls 2.1 is the realization of the potential in Dead
Souls 1.1. Since I am human, I'm sure a few bugs still lurk here and
there. Still, I'm happy and proud to say that the vast majority of bugs
and functionality shortcomings that were present in 1.1 no longer limit
the use of Dead Souls as a foundation for your MUD.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead Souls 2.1 is as great as it is because it
builds on the work of Descartes and his team. It's their achievement in
assembling Dead Souls 1.1 that made it possible. It's also thanks to
the work of the MudOS development community that DS runs in the first
place. And of course, without the indulgence and support of the online
Dead Souls community this day would not have come so soon. I thank you
all.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For people used to the frenetic pace of lib patches
that marked ds2.0, you'll need to get used to a much slower patch
cycle. Only major security bugs will be handled with the old-style
urgency. At this point my focus with Dead Souls 2.1 is stability.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The main flaw that remains in ds2.1 is that I have
not been able to
fill in all the documentation gaps. This is one of the projects I'll be
working on, and new documentation will be downloadable from the Dead
Souls site periodically.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will continue working on Dead Souls lib, but my
work
may not be as public. From this point on my focus will be on developing
new stuff, such as a multi-lib compatibility system, vehicles/mounts,
etc. The idea is that what I work on from this point on will be as
modular as possible, so that if people do eventually decide to use it,
it will have minimal impact on the systems they currently use.<br>
