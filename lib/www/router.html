<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is
the Dead Souls router?</span>
It's an intermud protocol version 3 <br>
router which follows intermud standards ( <a href="http://intermud.org/">http://intermud.org</a>
) and <br>
was written by the
legendary Tim@TimMUD.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Is it
private?</span><br>
<br>
No. Everyone is welcome.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the IP and port?</span>&nbsp;</span>
This may occasionally change. Such changes <br>
will be posted here when they happen. The current port and address is:<br>
<br>
</big>
<div style="text-align: center;"><big><big><big>IP:</big></big></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big> 149.152.218.102
&nbsp; &nbsp; </big></big></big><big><big><big>port:</big></big></big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big> 23</big></big></big><br>
</div>
<big><big style="font-weight: bold;"><br>
</big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How
do I set it up?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br>
<br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;">If you're
running r18 or higher, you need do nothing.</span><br>
If you're running r17 or r16, upgrading to r18 will<br>
be enough. <br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It doesn't
work<br>
<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few possible reasons for
this, mostly<br>
centered around the router being paranoid about<br>
security. The router resets frequently, and on that<br>
reset, your mud will be authenticated. Just be patient.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's the
point of a new router? Who died and made you intermud king?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of 27 March 2006, the intermud.org i3
router stopped<br>
functioning. There had been some talk on the dead_souls channel of how<br>
unreliable the i3 router was, and how we should make our own, <br>
etc, yakety schmakety.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March 27th was the last straw. For Dead Souls
developers, the <br>
dead_souls intermud channel was a vital resource for development
discussion<br>
and support. After being down for 24 hours, I decided it was time to <br>
implement a router that the Dead Souls muds could count on.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why did
you change it from port 25 to port 23?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; During testing, it was discovered that some ISP's
and hosting services block<br>
outbound connections to port 25, presumably for anti-spam reasons. Since<br>
port 23 is very often open for outbound connections, and it is rarely <br>
spam-firewalled, it seemed like a good choice. It's not like we were
doing<br>
anything else with it.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Isn't a
low port a security risk?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's not running the way you think.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Hey, XYZ
is broken and ABC works only half the time</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For crying out loud, email me and tell me. I need to
know. I'm still<br>
in the early stages of customizing and troubleshooting, so I need all
the<br>
bug reports I can get. Please email me at &lt;my name
here&gt;@users.sourceforge.net<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span></big><big></big><big><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is this
router actually any more stable? What's the uptime?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It looks like there's good potential for this <br>
router to be just as stable as the old *gjs, if not<br>
more so. The biggest danger comes from the fact that<br>
it's running on a computer on the campus of a university<br>
I went to 15 years ago, so some bored network admin<br>
might notice it and pull the plug. Should that ever <br>
happen, the new IP will be posted here.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The most likely thing to happen is that the machine<br>
it's on could lose power, despite being on UPS. If<br>
this happens, channel communication will be limited<br>
until someone emails me and tells me I need to <br>
reload channels. On the todo list is a plan to make<br>
channel data persist across server resets.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In general, however, about every other day or<br>
&nbsp;every third day I notice that *gjs is down or has <br>
been down for a couple of hours, and our new router <br>
is still going strong.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">You should
integrate your router with *gjs and enable failover</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will, just as soon as you send me the network code<br>
to do it. Until then, this is what you get.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Does it
bridge to the *gjs router?</span><br>
<br>
No.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How does
the router work?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim@TimMUD wrote a swell LPC based router that is<br>
basically a bunch of .h files you put into a TMI-2<br>
mud. You tinker with the settings a bit, and your TMI-2<br>
mud becomes an intermud router.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got rather violent on his code and shoehorned it<br>
into Dead Souls. It's a testament to Tim's skill that <br>
my crude fumblings were able to get the thing ported<br>
and working.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is router
code part of Dead Souls?</span><br>
<br>
With Tim's blessing I've included his I3 router<br>
in the Dead Souls distribution, after removing/replacing<br>
some non-Tim code. This means that any Dead Souls<br>
mud can serve as a router, should it wish to <br>
establish its own private intermud network. Eventually<br>
these individual routers may be part of a failover<br>
network, but there are no firm plans for this in place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I
become my own I3 router?</span><br>
<br>
Read the code in /secure/daemon/i3router. Understand it.<br>
Then modify it to suit you. I won't be posting step-<br>
by-step instructions on how to do this, because I believe<br>
this is one of those things that you really need to <br>
figure out on your own. If you can't figure it out<br>
by reading the code, I argue you have no business<br>
running the router.<br>
