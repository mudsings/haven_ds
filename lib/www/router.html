<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is
the Dead Souls router?</span>
It's an intermud protocol version 3 <br>
router which follows intermud standards ( <a href="http://intermud.org">http://intermud.org</a>
) and <br>
was written by the
legendary Tim@TimMUD.<br>
<br>
<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are
the rules?</span><br>
<br>
Please read the <a href="http://dead-souls.net/router_rules.html">router
rules</a> page. Refugees from *gjs are welcome,<br>
so long as they abide by those rules. Please keep trash talk <br>
on the free_speech channel.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Is it
private?</span><br>
<br>
No. Everyone is welcome.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline;">What is the IP and port?</span>&nbsp;</span>
This may occasionally change. Such changes <br>

Is
is the router "secure"?<br>
<br>
</span>Nope. Read this: <a

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span>Bottom line: Don't tell secrets on the router.<br>
<br>
</big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's
the
point of a new router? Who died and made you intermud king?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the morning of 27 March 2006, the intermud.org i3
router stopped<br>
functioning. There had been some talk on the dead_souls channel of how<br>
unreliable the i3 router was, and how we should make our own, <br>
etc, yakety schmakety.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; March 27th was the last straw. For Dead Souls
developers, the <br>
dead_souls intermud channel was a vital resource for development
discussion<br>
and support. After being down for 24 hours, I decided it was time to <br>
implement a router that the Dead Souls muds could count on.<br>
<br>
<br>
</big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">ZOMG!
The
*gjs router is down now! It's your fault!</span><br>
<br>
I honestly have no idea at all what happened to the gjs<br>
router. During June and July of 2006, it seemed to be<br>
up about as often as it was down...it was unreliable in<br>
the extreme. I'd never seen it that bad before.<br>
<br>
Then, a few weeks ago, while discussing this unreliability:<br>
<br>
<small><span style="font-weight: bold;">[2006.08.01-13.45]
Salius@Elanathia &lt;imud_gossip&gt; so what keeps happening, why does
it crash</span><br style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[2006.08.01-14.03] Cratylus
&lt;intergossip&gt; who runs it? are they ever on?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">[2006.08.01-14.05] Zakk@Lima Bean
&lt;imud_gossip&gt; 'run' hahaha etc</span></small><br>
<br>
And that's the last transmission I'm aware of, as of <br>
today, 31 August, 2006. As if it weren't bad enough that it looks<br>
like it's down for the count, it also appears Zakk <br>
had the last word.<br>
<br>
Please note. If I'd known gjs would die, I would not have<br>
made the intergossip channel a default for Dead Souls<br>
muds. I had no intent to be The New Intermud For Everyone,<br>
and I didn't know it would happen, so please don't imagine<br>
I'm trying to reform anyone. I'm just running my own router,<br>
to which you're invited if you follow the rules.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>
How
do I set it up?</span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> <br>
<br>
</span>Instructions for Dead Souls 2 MUDs:<span
 style="text-decoration: underline;"><br>
</span><span style="font-style: italic; font-weight: bold;"></span>To
switch back and forth between the routers, use the<br>
switchrouter command. For syntax and instructions,<br>
type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">help switchrouter</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">It doesn't
work<br>
<br>
</span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There are a few possible reasons for
this, mostly<br>
centered around the router being paranoid about<br>
security. The router resets frequently, and on that<br>
reset, your mud will be authenticated. Just be patient.<br>
If it's been more than a day or so, email me at<br>
&lt;my name here&gt;@comcast.net<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To know for sure if this is the problem, change your<br>
mud name to something unique and reboot. If you<br>
connect to intermud, you know that was the issue.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also note, the name is yatmim, with an <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">M</span> at the end<br>
and not an <span style="font-weight: bold;">N</span>. It stands for
Yet Another TMI Mud. yatmim.<br>
Lower case letters. I'll see if I can make the router<br>
more forgiving of that typo.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Getting the router name wrong is the number one
cause of<br>
errors. Also, once you get it wrong, your own client<br>
cache might keep the old one, even if you change your<br>
intermud client code. Make sure you purge the i3 data<br>
cache before you try again.<br>
</big><big><br>
</big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How
does
the router work?</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tim@TimMUD wrote a swell LPC based router that is<br>
basically a bunch of .h files you put into a TMI-2<br>
mud. You tinker with the settings a bit, and your TMI-2<br>
mud becomes an intermud router.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I got rather violent on his code and shoehorned it<br>
into Dead Souls. It's a testament to Tim's skill that <br>
my crude fumblings were able to get the thing ported<br>
and working.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is router
code part of Dead Souls?</span><br>
<br>
With Tim's blessing I've included his I3 router<br>
in the Dead Souls distribution, after removing/replacing<br>
some non-Tim code. This means that any Dead Souls<br>
mud can serve as a router, should it wish to <br>
establish its own private intermud network. Eventually<br>
these individual routers may be part of a failover<br>
network, but there are no firm plans for this in place.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I
become my own I3 router?</span><br>
<br>
Read the code in /secure/daemon/i3router. Understand it.<br>
Then modify it to suit you. I won't be posting step-<br>
by-step instructions on how to do this, because I believe<br>
this is one of those things that you really need to <br>
figure out on your own. If you can't figure it out<br>
by reading the code, I argue you have no business<br>
running the router.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a
 name="fascist"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I am so SICK of
you being an intermud FASCIST</span><br>
<br>
It's puzzling how often I get this. Even though the router<br>
rules are prominently shown, and I have shown willingness to<br>
confront offenders, some people still insist on trying to<br>
make racist comments on the protected channels, or <br>
try to harsh out newbies.<br>
<br>
I don't know which part of <span style="font-weight: bold;">this is
not the old router</span> and<br>
<a href="router_rules.html"><span style="font-weight: bold;">this
router has
enforced rules</span></a> is hard to understand. <br>
There is, perhaps, a sense of entitlement to any channel<br>
named "intergossip" regardless of the router. <br>
<br>
I really don't ask for much. Just follow the rules on the<br>
six protected channels, and adhere to their declared topics.<br>
You're here as a guest, by choice. If you don't like it,<br>
you are free to make your own channel for trash talk,<br>
and of course, you are free to disconnect from yatmim at <br>
any time.<br>
