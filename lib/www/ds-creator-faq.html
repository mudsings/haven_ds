 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br><br>What's this FAQ about?</span><br><br>	There are common issues and questions that crop<br>up for most new creators. This document is intended to<br>ease or at least shorten what can be a steep learning<br>curve.<br><br><br></big></pre>
<hr
 style="width: 100%; height: 2px; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<pre style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><big><big
 style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Section 1: Getting Started</big></big><br><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">My question isn't on here. Where can I get an answer?</span><br><br>There are four main ways to get specific answers:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">1)</span> Ask your mud's administrator, or other creators on<br>your mud by using the cre channel, like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cre does the flux capacitor use verbs or add_actions?</span><br><br>To know what local channels are available on your<br>mud, type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">lines</span><br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">2)</span> Your mud is probably on the intermud3 network. If<br>your administrator has not restricted intermud channels,<br>you should be able to ask questions on the Dead Souls<br>intermud channel, with a command like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ds hi! can someone tell me what room Leo lives in?</span><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">3)</span> If intermud is down, or nobody is answering, or<br>you have a bug to report, you can also try emailing<br>me, the author of this doc, at: &lt;my name here&gt;@users.sourceforge.com<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">4)</span> If intermud is down, you can also log into the<br>Dead Souls demo/development mud at <a
 href="telnet://dead-souls.net:6666">dead-souls.net 6666</a><br>    This mud automatically promotes users to<br>creator status, allowing guests to get a feel for<br>what developing on Dead Souls is like, and to provide<br>examples of current and not-yet-released lib code.<br>    You can try to log into that mud and see if anyone<br>is available to answer your question.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">Important note about asking on &lt;<span
 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">ds</span>&gt;:</span><br><br>	Part of the reason this FAQ was written is that<br>people who ask questions on the ds channel often do not<br>realize that same question has been asked many times<br>before. If you ask something like "how do I read the<br>channel messages I missed?" without first bothering to<br>read this doc and others, you just might get a response<br>that's less friendly than you might have expected.<br>	People on the channel really want to help you,<br>but if it seems like you're not willing to put in the<br>time to try to help yourself, they might choose to <br>ignore you until you gather some clues on your own.<br><br>	Something else to remember is that we are not<br>on your mud and we don't see what you see. "Why won't<br>my workroom update" lacks enough information to let<br>anyone try to help, but "when i try to update my<br>workroom I get &lt;error message&gt;" might.<br><br>	Similarly, some things don't have an answer<br>that is suited to ds. "could someone help me <br>understand the score.c file?" or "how do quests work?"<br>have answers that are long, complex, and are<br>already covered in the documentation available<br>to you.<br><br>	Some stuff just doesn't have an answer <br>that can be explained to you unless you already<br>have the experience you'd need to know the answer.<br>for example:<br><br>- <span
 style="font-style: italic;">How do I make a stargate that has a dial for</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">  going to different places?</span><br><br>- <span
 style="font-style: italic;">How do I make it so a player can be on different</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">planes of existence, and what they see when they</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">look around depends on what plane they're on?</span><br><br>- <span
 style="font-style: italic;">How do I add limbs so people can wear stuff</span><br
 style="font-style: italic;"><span style="font-style: italic;">like kneepads on the knee only?</span><br><br>These three questions illustrate things that are<br>totally doable, but whose explanation is so<br>complex and full of judgment calls that there <br>is no way of satisfying the question without<br>making you magically understand intermediate-level<br>LPC coding. <br>	That doesn't mean they're bad ideas, or<br>even that hard to implement. It's just that<br>the questions can't be answered until you read<br>and understand the Creator's Manual, and by that<br>time, you'll know the answer on your own.<br><br>	Make sure you've read the docs, then ask<br>the question in a way that makes it clear you aren't<br>just a lazy person who wants other people to do her<br>work, but rather a hardworking builder who has<br>tried to fix something and needs a specific answer<br>to a specific question that isn't already in the<br>FAQ's or the docs.<br><br>	Critiques are welcome, but they should<br>be constructive. "This combat system is slow and<br>stupid" is unhelpful and might be taken as a<br>hostile statement. Instead you could phrase it <br>in a way such as: "Combat is slower than I <br>expected. Why? I used to play on LeetFooMud and it<br>took less than a minute to kill Tiamat." It's still<br>a bit clueless, but it's a fair question that can<br>be answered on its own terms without starting<br>a flamestorm.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The ds channel is too spammy. It's distracting me.</span><br><br>Enable or disable a channel by typing just its name. Like:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ds</span><br><br></big><big><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">All I did was change one thing in a file, and now it won't update. Help!</span><br><br>	You should make it a habit to make backup copies of files<br>before editing them. That way, if you screw up the code, you can<br>just copy the backup to the original filename.<br><br>	A convenient way to do this is the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">bk</span> command. See<br>the <a
 href="debugging.html">debugging page</a> for an example of its use.<br><br>	If you are using Windows, you need to be aware of the<br>linefeed problem. unix text files and DOS text files have different<br>formatting. If you edit files in Notepad, then try to update them,<br>you may find that the file no longer updates, no matter what<br>you do. The difference is usually invisible to you, so you can't<br>tell why a file that looks exactly the same as before now won't<br>work.<br><br>	Dead Souls expects unix-formatted text, and if you feed it<br>something else, the results aren't likely to be to your<br>satisfaction. Make sure you use an editor that respects unix<br>text. In Windows 2000, WordPad seems to do a reasonable job of not<br>completely screwing things. It does, however, add carriage<br>returns to your lines, so when you look at them in ed, you'll<br>see a bunch of "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">^M</span>"'s all over the place.<span
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><br>	If you still have trouble, take a look at the <a
 href="debugging.html">debugging page.</a><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The mud editor is confusing the heck out of me. It's too hard to use.</span><br><br>Check out the <a
 href="editor.html">MUD Editor tutor</a><a href="editor.html">ial</a>. It should ease the pain a little.<br></big><big><br><br><br></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">When I log in, everything is screwed up, and I can't do anything!</span><br><br>This happens sometimes when you log out while carrying an object<br>with broken code. If for example, you are wearing a vest, and then you<br>edit the code for it, but it doesn't work anymore, then you log out,<br>what happens is the next time you log in the mud will try to restore an<br>item in your inventory that throws an error, and your login<br>gets stuck halfway.<br><br>If you find that when you log in things are all screwed up for<br>you, use the rescue login feature. For me, this means I would<br>login as <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cratylus_rescue</span> instead of <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cratylus</span>. My inventory<br>will get wiped before my playerfile is loaded, and I'll<br>be able to log in with no problems.<br></big><big><br><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Ok, I'm a creator now. What am I supposed to do?</span><br><br>Ask your admin.<br><br>	If you're like most other creators, you have<br>a creative vision you want to implement and share with others.<br>you want to create dragons, or spaceships, perhaps dragons<br><span
 style="font-style: italic;">in</span> spaceships. This makes you a "builder".<br><br>	As a builder, your job is to learn how your mud<br>works so you can get your neat ideas turned into a<br>virtual reality. As you might have guessed, nobody is<br>going to jack into your brain and upload coding ability<br>into you. You need to learn how to move around, how<br>the creation system works, and yes, you'll need at least<br>some passing acquaintance with the stuff your mud is<br>made of: files written in the LPC language format.<br><br>	The good news is that it's nowhere near as hard<br>to learn as C++. LPC is very powerful, but it doesn't<br>require you to be a master to get simple things done.<br><br>Your first steps as a new creator probably should<br>go something like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">1)</span> Talk to your admin. Understand what is expected of<br>you, and what the rules of your mud are. <br><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">2)</span> Go to your workroom by typing: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">home</span>. Read the helpful <br>notes that are posted there for you.<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">3)</span> Read the Player's Handbook, cover to cover. It isn't<br>long, and you will need every bit of information in there.<br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">This is not a suggestion. You need to read the handbook.</span><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">4)</span> Open the chest in your workroom, and play around <br>with the tools and toys in there. Having read the<br>handbook will help you deal with any issues you have<br>handling these items.<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">5)</span> Type <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">wiz</span> to go to the Creator's Hall, and if there<br>are any posts on the board, read them. To read the<br>first post: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">read 1</span>. To read the second, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">read 2</span>, and so on.<br>	If you decide to write on the board,<br>remamber that to exit "writing" or "input" mode,<br>you need to enter a dot on a line all by itself,<br>like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">.</span><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">6)</span> Once you get a feel for how to move around, <br>what playing here is like, and how to do stuff, you<br>can start exploring your creator powers. To get<br>a grasp of the very basics of navigating through<br>files and directories, type:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">more /doc/BASICS</span><br><br>	Yes, you must include capital letters. Dead<br>Souls distinguishes between upper and lower case<br>letters in filenames.<br><br>To get a feel for what Dead Souls LPC code looks like,<br>wander about town and use the about command to read<br>code that compose the objects there. For example:<br><br></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">goto /domains/town/room/road<br><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">about here</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">about beggar</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"></span>	Or move around in your own home<br>directory and check out the defaults and templates<br>there:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cd /realms/&lt;yourname&gt;/area/npc</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">more fighter.c</span><br><br>	To bring a copy of that fighter to life:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">clone fighter</span><br><br>	To make him dance:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">force fighter to dance</span><br><br>	To kill him:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">zap fighter</span><br><br>	To get rid of his corpse:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">dest corpse</span><br>	<br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">7)</span> Once you're done having fun with your godlike<br>powers, it's time to start learning how to make<br>fun stuff of your own.<br><br>	For a quick start in building, you<br>can start reading the Creator's Manual at<br>chapter 31, which is where the QCS section begins:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">read chapter 31 in manual</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">read chapter 32 in manual</span><br><br>	and so on.<br></big><big><br>	That's fine to start with, but eventually<br>you'll need to read the whole Creator's Manual.<br>If you don't, 90% of the questions you ask about<br>code could be fairly answered with: "read the manual."<br><br><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">This is weird...where is the online builder? How does</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">new stuff get compiled?</span><br><br>	Dead Souls can be very strange to people used <br>to non-LPC muds. This is because many other kinds of<br>muds use a system where the mud is written in C++,<br>and to make changes, you need to add C++ code to the<br>source, recompile it, then reboot the mud.<br>	In that kind of system, building is done with<br>tools where you fill in blanks and code is generated<br>for you. I presume that some C++ expertise is <br>required for doing anything unusual or fancy.<br><br>	If you come from this kind of environment,<br>you may be in for a little disorientation. On a Dead<br>Souls mud, there is no need for compiling code. You<br>don't need to reboot the mud for new stuff to<br>be available.<br><br>	You can add your new Orc God of War to the<br>game (after you code him, of course) with two <br>simple commands:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">update /realms/&lt;you&gt;/area/npc/grimmash.c</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">clone </span></big><big
 style="font-weight: bold;">/realms/&lt;you&gt;/area/npc/grimmash.c</big><big><br><br></big><big>	You're now face to face with him. This makes<br>Dead Souls, like most LPC muds, very flexible in<br>what can be done, and very stable in terms of<br>needing few reboots. Reboots typically are<br>necessary only when someone breaks important<br>code, or to implement major mud-wide changes.<br><br>	So, just write your code, and update it.<br>It's that simple. There are two main ways to do<br>this. The easiest way is with the QCS, or quick<br>creation system. With the QCS, you don't even need<br>to look at code. You just issue a few commands,<br>and your new whatever is there. <a
 href="example.html">Check out an example<br>of the QCS here.</a><br>	<br>	To learn the QCS, read the Creator's <br>Manual starting on chapter 31.<br><br>	The other way to create on-line is<br>with the ed command. The ed editor is a powerful<br>and flexible way of editing files. Some people<br>find it difficult at first, and you might even<br>be able to avoid it for a while if you mostly<br>just use QCS. However, you'll eventually need to<br>know a little about ed. <a
 href="editor.html">For a tutorial, go here</a>.<br><br>	For more detailed documentation, <br>type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">help ed</span><br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I explored around in /domains/Ylsrim and &lt;XYZ&gt; is broken</span><br><br>Ylsrim is kept in the distribution as a kind of<br>sentimental artifact. It's the demo area that the<br>original Dead Souls shipped with, and although<br>it's mostly been fixed up to work with Dead SOuls 2,<br>things can behave unexpectedly.<br><br><br></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I explored around in /domains/town and &lt;XYZ&gt; is broken</span><br><br>Please send me an email and let me know, so I <br>can fix it. Also let me know if something in /domains/default<br>is hosed up.<br></big><big><br></big></pre>

 style="font-weight: bold;"><big><small>Section 2: Code</small><br></big></big></big></big><big><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's the QCS?</span><br><br>Please see the <a
 href="example.html">QCS example page</a> for an explanation of this<br>important Dead Souls system.</big><br><big><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">SetUnique doesn't work.</span><br><br>	SetUnique() is probably doing something you<br>don't expect. When an item is loaded into memory, and<br>it has an inventory, it first checks each of those items<br>for whether it's supposed to be unique.<br>	If it is supposed to be unique, then we look<br>through the list of loaded objects to see if there is<br>one of these items already cloned. If there is, then<br>we don't clone a new one.<br>	What this means is that if I kidnap Leo the<br>archwizard and hold him in my workroom, another one will<br>not appear in the basement until my Leo is dested.<br><br>	Note, however, that this does NOT mean that the<br>mud will never have two Leos. I can clone however many<br>Leos I want. But as long as one or more cloned Leos<br>exist, the basement will not make another. That's<br>what SetUnique means.<br><br>	Now, if the behavior you're seeing is different<br>from what I described, maybe SetUnique <span
 style="font-style: italic;">is</span> broken,<br>and you should email me with what you're seeing.<br><br><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I made a magic wand that disappears after 10 minutes.</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">But if a player logs out and log back in, they have</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">another 10 minutes! How do I fix this?</span><br><br>What's happening is that you are keeping<br>track of how old the wand is, perhaps with a<br>variable named Age. But if the player quits and<br>logs back in, then the wand gets cloned again, resetting<br>all its values, including Age, to the original.<br><br>	The way to make the Age variable survive<br>logouts is with AddSave. If you give your variable to<br>AddSave as an argument, that variable gets saved when<br>the user quits, and when they log back in, it is restored,<br>preventing cheating.<br><br>	See /obj/wed_ring.c for an example.<br><br><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Where is it saved?</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><br>In the player's playerfile, along with the values of all<br>the objects they were carrying when they quit.<br>	<br><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I add or remove emotes?</span><br><br>That is an admin job. You admin would use the<br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">addemote</span> or <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">removeemote</span> commands.<br><br><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How can I tell what files something inherits?</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br>Use the showtree command. To know what files<br>are inherited by your robe, for example:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">showtree /domains/default/armor/robe<br><br></span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How can I find the filename of something?</span><br><br>If it's in your environment: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">scan here</span><br>If it's in your possession: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">scan me</span><br><br>The number sign (#) and numbers at the end are that <br>object's unique identifier.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's the largest integer usable by the mud?</span><br><br>2147483647<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How can I find out what functions exist in something?</span><br><br>Get its filename and use the functions efun. For example:<br><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">eval return functions(load_object("/domains/town/obj/sign"))</span><br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">object::init() is broken!</span><br><br>It isn't really. Unless you're coding a lib<br>item, you should not be inheriting LIB_OBJECT for<br>"tangible things" anyway. You should inherit LIB_ITEM.<br><br>The reason </big><big>object::init() fails is that LIB_OBJECT<br>doesn't have an init() function to call.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">if(ob-&gt;GetFoo()) seems to break, but I don't know why</span><br><br>This function will error if ob does not exist. Unless<br>you are 100% positive ob will exist (and really, even if so),<br>it should look like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">if(ob &amp;&amp; ob-&gt;GetFoo())<br><br></span>	Which means "if ob exists, and it has a foo".<br>This way, if there is no ob, the check stops right there<br>without getting hosed up on the next step.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I add color to my descriptions?</span><br><br>There are various markup tokens you can use for this. They look like this:<br><br>write("%^BOLD%^GREEN%^ <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 102, 0); font-weight: bold;">This text would be in bold green letters</span> %^RESET%^ and this would not.");<br><br>The %^RESET% is important. Without it, unpredictable things can happen.<br><br>To know what colors are available, type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">colors</span><br><br>You should probably avoid color unless there is a compelling <br>reason for its use. Many mud admins discourage it because it can <br>distract from the game and cause uniformity issues: most mud <br>admins feel their mud text should look more or less<br>the same everywhere.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I turn the integer 42 into the string "forty-two"?</span><br><br>cardinal(42)<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Can I use !=NULL as a test?</span><br><br>In theory, I guess so, but I doubt it'll work by default, and I'd<br>discourage you from doing anything so non-LPC-standard. <br>Instead try something like one of the following:<br><br>if(variable)<br>if(sizeof(variable))<br>if(variable != "")<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I want to create and test a new command for the mud,</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">but I'm not admin so I can't put anything in the</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">normal command paths. What can I do?</span><br><br>Put your new command in your homedir's cmd/<br>subdirectory. A sample command is there already<br>to serve as a template. When you add a command, type:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">update /daemon/command</span><br><br>for it to show up in your path.<br><br><br><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">How do skills work?</span><br><br>Skills are generally class-based, meaning that they are <br>specified in the class files found in /secure/cfg/classes.<br>Skills are only meaningful in terms of library objects that<br>understand them.<br><br>For example, a fighter's blade attack is useful because<br>player.c and combat.c make use of this skill as a<br>modifier.<br><br>But adding a basketweaving skill to a class is not<br>helpful unless there are library objects (looms, perhaps,<br>or straw) and verbs (weaving, maybe?) that make<br>use of that skill.<br><br>An upcoming feature is race-based skills, such<br>as poison bite or breath attack. These skills are<br>specified in /secure/cfg/races.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do classes work?</span><br><br>Basically, having a class gives you special skills.<br>That's it. See the above section, "How do skills work?"<br><br><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do virtual rooms work?</span><br><br>Virtual rooms are rooms generated on the fly by a<br>virtual room server. You program that server with<br>the room descriptions, the number of them, <br>etc, and the virtual server can make available<br>a grid of rooms with your descriptions.<br><br>	This allows you to create, for example,<br>a vast desert, or a large jungle, comprised of<br>dozens, or hundreds, or thousands of rooms<br>without having to manually code each and every<br>single room.<br><br>	For an example, take a look at<br><br>/domains/town/virtual/</big><big><br><br><br></big><big><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are lfuns, sefuns and efuns?</span><br><br></big><big>	<br>Sefuns and efuns are functions available to all objects on the<br>mud. Any object may need to know what time() it is, so rather<br>than have a time() function in every file that needs it, which<br>could be many, there is a time() function built into the<br>game that any object can use. An efun is built into the<br>driver, so there is no LPC code to look at. A sefun is a<br>simulated efun, coded in LPC. Sefuns are kept in /secure/sefun.<br><br>Lfuns are functions specific to library objects. A shirt,<br>for example, has functions that a sword may not need, so<br>the LIB_ARMOR and LIB_WEAPON files contain their own functions,<br>not shared by other files (it's more complicated than this,<br>but that's the idea). These functions are library<br>functions, or lfuns. Typically they are found in the objects<br>defined by the files in /lib.<br><br>For a lot more detail on efuns and sefuns, see the </big><big><a
 href="ds-admin-faq.html">admin FAQ</a></big><big>.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Why are there more sefun doc files than sefun files?</span><br><br>Sefun files, like /secure/sefun/strings.c, often contain<br>more than just one sefun. Therefore, there will be more<br>files documenting individual functions than there are<br>files containing sefuns.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I edited a file but now the reload command is complaining.</span><br><br>There are two commonly used commands for loading<br>objects: update and reload.<br><br>When you want to load a file into memory, you use<br>update, for example: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">update /domains/default/room/road</span><br><br>When you want to replace a cloned object with a<br>version that uses the latest code in a file, you<br>use reload, for example: <span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is the difference between filter() and foreach()? How do I use them?</span><br><br>Both of these efuns can act on the individual members of an array. <br><br>For example, if you wanted to have an array named mystuff which<br>contains the filenames of all objects in your inventory that<br>inherit LIB_ARMOR:<br><br>using filter:<br><br><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">object *stuff = filter(deep_inventory(this_player()), (: inherits(LIB_ARMOR,$1) :) );</span><br
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">string *mystuff = filter(stuff, (: base_name($1)+".c" :) );</span><br><br>using foreach:<br><br><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">string *mystuff = ({});</span><br
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">foreach( object ob in </span></big><big

 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><span style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">}</span><br><br>There are arguments favoring the use of either. I won't get into <br>it. As far as I can tell, it's really a question of preference. <br>	You can structure these functions more elegantly<br>than shown here, to best suit you. But this is the idea.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">member_array() is returning exactly the wrong thing</span><br><br>It probably isn't. member_array() seems somewhat counterintuitive<br>at first, because it often returns a 0 as a "hit".<br><br>What this function is doing is checking to see whether the<br>first argument is a member of the array specified in the second<br>argument, and then tells you *which* element it is. for example:<br><br><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">member_array( "bar", ({ "foo", "bar", "baz" }) ) <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">returns: 1</span></span><br
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><br style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);"><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">member_array( "foo", ({ "foo", "bar", "baz" }) ) <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">returns: 0</span></span><br><br>Why does it return 0? Because "foo" is element 0 of the<br>array. If this_array == </big><big>({ "foo", "bar", "baz" }), then<br>this_array[0] is "foo". So member_array("foo", this_array)<br>would return 0.<br><br>If the first argument is not a member of the array, member<br>array returns -1. So that:<br><br><span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">member_array( "shiz", ({ "foo", "bar", "baz" }) )</span> returns: -1<br><br><br>Example:<br><br>Does this player know how to polka? Return 1 for yes:<br><br>RIGHT: <span
 style="color: rgb(0, 0, 153);">if(member_array("polka dancing", this_player()-&gt;GetSkills()) != -1) return 1;</span><br><br>WRONG: </big><big

But worse than this is that if<br>you actually can't polka dance, this second way will incorrectly tell<br>you that you can. Given random input, the second way would be wrong more than<br>half the time.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I'm trying to add two mappings together and the results are bizarre</span><br><br>Adding mappings together has to be done just so in order for<br>it to work the way one might expect. What can happen in <br>mapping arithmetic is that in the process of trying to<br>add the values of one mapping to another, you can change the<br>values of a mapping you didn't intend to. The deal is a<br>conflict between passing data by reference or by value. To<br>be sure that you don't accidentally modify an innocent<br>bystander, use the add_maps() sefun. For example:<br><br>MyMap = add_maps(HisMap, HerMap);<br><br>or<br><br>MyMap = add_maps(MyMap, HerMap);<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">When str = "abc", str[1] is 98, not "b". What gives?</span><br><br>What you're getting here is the ASCII code of element 1.<br>If you have to have that element as a string, use the<br>convert_ascii() sefun, like this:<br><br>convert_ascii(str[1])<br><br>You can instead use ranges, so that:<br><br>str[0..0] == "a"<br>str[1..1] == "b"<br>str[1..2] == "bc"<br></big><big></big><big><br>If you use ranges, do not use the convert_ascii() sefun.<br><br><br

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What should I do or not do in my code?</span><br><br>1) Avoid using call_out() as much as humanly possible.<br>Use heart_beat() to time things instead.<br><br>2) Don't code stuff that replicates itself. <br><br>3) Don't code stuff that circumvents security. For<br>example, knowing that an admin is logged on but<br>invisible isn't much help to you if he bans you<br>for coding a tool to find him.<br><br>4) foreach() and filter() are faster than for() loops,<br>and harder to screw up.<br><br>5) switch() is faster and more economical than if()<br>for multiple evaluations.<br><br>6) Don't use callouts.<br><br>7) Don't use add_action for something that already<br>has a verb. There is no point in making an add_action<br>for "throw", for example. It's just going to confuse<br>players when your "throw" doesn't behave the way<br>"throw" does everywhere else on the mud.<br><br>8) Callouts are bad, mkay?<br><br>9) Don't code delays by using loops. This affects the<br>whole mud. If an action is to be delayed, use heart_beat().<br><br></big></pre>

therefore</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">someone

can avoid players' tedious language learning process</span><br

<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">How
do I find the location of a verb or command?</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Use the which
command. For example:</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">which
zap</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">

update</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">If 'which'
doesn't find it, the command is probably built into</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">some object
you inherit, like the command shell or the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">hooks for the

<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">How
do I make a quest?</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Think of a quest in terms of the result. The result of a quest is</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">a player
receiving quest points and a quest title. </span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
This means that pretty much anything can be a quest. If</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">you've coded
a rock to provide quest points and a quest title</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">when it is
picked up, well, there's your Rock Quest. However,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">you usually
want to make things a bit more challenging. </span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
A quest can be as boring as "pick up the red rock" or</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">it can be a
challenging metaphysical inquiry into the</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">nature of
consciousness. If quest points and a quest title are</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">at the end of
a series of actions, then that series of actions</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">is a quest.</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What those actions should be are entirely up to your</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">imagination.

an example. You <span style="font-style: italic;">did</span> read the
Player's Handbook,</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">right?</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Take a look at Leo the Archwizard's code for an example </span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of the
mechanics of solving a quest.</span><br

<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Read the
Player's Handbook already, please.</span><br

<pre style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><big><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">My wandering monster escaped from my workroom! How can</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I find him?</span><br><br>If its name is jabberwock, try:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">findobj jabberwock</span><br><br>You can also probably just:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">goto jabberwock</span></big></pre>
<big><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline; font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">I
ran findobj on something but it says no environment. Where is it?</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Right where
it says. Some objects create a "master copy" of themselves</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">when they are
cloned. This copy remains loaded in memory even if</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">that cloned
object goes away. You can distinguish between cloned</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">objects and
master copies by the number sign&nbsp; and number at the end</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">of cloned
objects. The master copy has no instance number. It is </span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">simply loaded
code, and does not "exist" in a way accessible to your player</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">object on the
mud.</span><br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<br style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Sometimes a
cloned object will lose its environment. This is usually </span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">caused by an
error and is not a good thing. Dead Souls runs a</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">"reaper"
daemon that periodically searches memory for cloned</span><br
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">
<span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">objects that
lack an environment, and they are destroyed.<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I
update everything in a directory?</span><br>
<br>
You really shouldn't. There are very few cases I can think<br>
of where updating an entire directory is something an average<br>
creator needs to do. How often do you edit multiple<br>
files at once without individually updating them? Good<br>
coding practice is to update the one file you just worked on to know<br>
if it works at all.<br>
<br>
I also discourage it because when you do this, you lag the mud <br>
considerably. I/O is the most resource intensive kind of operation, <br>
and updating is on its own quite resource intensive. Updating a <br>
directory with dozens of files in it will cause a noticeable hiccup <br>
in the rest of the mud.<br>
<br>
If you are determined to do this</span></big><big><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">, though, the
command is :<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">update /path/to/dir/*</span></span></big><br>
<big><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I don't
like getting colors on my screen. How do I stop it?</span><br>
<br>
Type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">terminal unknown</span><br>
<br>
then type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">save</span><br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Um...I
want colors back now please</span><br>
<br>
</span></big><big><span
 style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;">Type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">terminal ansi</span><br>
<br>
then type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">save</span></span></big><br>
<big><span style="font-family: courier new,courier,monospace;"><br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I can type
'n' and move north, but 'north' doesn't work.</span><br>
<br>
Technically, you can't 'n' either. When you type 'n', what<br>
it happening is that your preset alias turns that 'n'<br>
into the command line '<span style="font-weight: bold;">go north</span>'.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Because you do not have an alias 'north' that expands<br>
to '<span style="font-weight: bold;">go north</span>', 'north' doesn't
take you anywhere. But<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;">go north</span> will.<br>
