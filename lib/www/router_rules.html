point of this
router being up is not free speech.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="2"></a>2)</span> This router
is up for the
following purposes:<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To provide technical help for LP muds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To provide a friendly space for chat between muds.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * To test and improve mud communication systems,
such as intermud mail.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="3"></a>3)</span> The router
is not up for
testing security of an I3 router. Attempting<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to exploit the router is not ok, and not "cool". If
you find<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; a security weakness please email me so I can handle it
discreetly.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; You will get full credit for the discovery when the patch
comes out.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="5"></a>5)</span> The
following are not
tolerated on those channels: hate speech, social engineering<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; hacks, unwarranted hostility to newbies, spamming,
commercial advertising. All of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; these will be judged by my subjective opinion of what
constitutes a violation. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; Types of violations can be added to this list without
warning by me.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="6"></a>6)</span> You may
create intermud channels for your mud. These channels can<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; have any content you want that is permissible by all
applicable laws. I<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; don't want to control the intermud with an iron hand. I
just want those six<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; channels listed above to be a safe place for newbies to
congregate, socialize,<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; and/or get work done. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="7"></a>7)</span> If you don't
like these
rules, set up your own router. Or go play on the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; gjs router, if ever it comes back up.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="8"></a>8)</span> I will not
help or support
you in any way in setting up a router, or<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; in creating a channel for your mud. These undocumented
procedures require<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; expertise to accomplish that you have to earn on your own
by reading<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; the code on your mud and the i3 specs ( intermud.org ).<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="9"></a>9)</span> I will not
ban a mud just
because of your tattle tales. I expect you<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; to handle your own personal problems. If someone bugs you,
use the earmuff<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; command. Earmuff the person, or earmuff the mud, or just
stay off the<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; channel in question. The chances I'll step into something
like this<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; are slight, so don't look to me to solve your online
disputes. I'm<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; your Dutch uncle, not your coddling mommy. <br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold;"><a name="10"></a>10)</span> I'm only
human and
sometimes I'll err in judgment. If you think I have<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; made an error, please email me. Perhaps I banned
your mud out of<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a misunderstanding. Perhaps the problem on your mud
has been fixed.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I try to be open minded about this stuff, if you try
to be reasonable.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Clarifications and suggestions:<br>
<br>
- A channel may have customs more restrictive than the rules here show.<br>
For example, because ds and dchat are turned on by default on<br>
Dead Souls muds, and I don't want newbies immediately scared away <br>
and/or offended, I ask that foul language be avoided when <br>
possible. On the other hand, a channel like intergossip has <br>
the tradition of being quite raunchy and not<br>
geared toward technical talk, so you might find a hostile reaction<br>
when asking for code help there. Use your common sense and try to<br>
follow the customs of a channel. Showing up and expecting a<br>
channel to accept your topic and discussion habits<br>
no matter what is not really a good idea.<br>
<br>
- On a related note, please remember that yatmim is not gjs, and<br>
the customs of gjs channels may not be acceptable on yatmim, <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">even <br>
if the channel names are the same</span>.<br>
<br>
- An email address in your startup packet is not explicitly demanded,<br>
as you can see. However, it's *strongly* urged that you put a valid<br>
email address in there. This is because if someone on your mud is<br>
getting out of hand, or your connection is causing technical problems,<br>
I need a way to talk to someone in charge of things on your mud. <br>
<br>
- When someone on a mud is violating rules, they usually get a<br>
number of warnings, and if they are not admins, their admins are<br>
also notified as possible. Whether warnings are issued is obviously<br>
dependent on the type of behavior. Sufficiently disruptive behavior<br>
(at my discretion) can subject a mud to immediate action without<br>
warning. But this is extremely rare. Warnings are provided<br>
when reasonable. If the behavior doesn't stop, then that mud may be<br>
banned from the channel where it's causing problems. If the mud<br>
then causes problems on other channels, it may be banned from<br>
the router entirely. This is a drastic and very unusual situation.<br>
For an example of how this enforcement plays out in reality, <br>
please visit this URL:<br>

<a href="http://lpmuds.net/forum/index.php?webtag=LPC&amp;msg=177.1">http://lpmuds.net/forum/index.php?webtag=LPC&amp;msg=177.1</a><br>
<br>
- Sometimes a mud causes technical problems and I can't get<br>
a hold of an admin. In the past, for example, some muds have<br>
accidentally messed up their intermud daemon, and wound up<br>
spamming the router with dozens of connection requests<br>
per second. Because they are not fully connected, they can't be<br>
contacted through channels, and because their admins weren't<br>
checking their email, I couldn't get them to stop. In a case<br>
like this, the mud generally will get firewalled out, so that<br>
the router stops receiving any data at all from that mud. If<br>
your mud just won't connect to the router no matter what,<br>
something like this may have happened. Email me and we'll<br>
straighten it out.<br>
