<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been frustrated for some time with the way<br>
the LPUniversity site seems almost intentionally<br>
designed to be confusing and inscrutable to newbie<br>
mudders. For example, if I didn't happen to know<br>
the site is supposed to be an LPC mud resource, the<br>
front page wouldn't be much help in informing me.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So I bought a domain with the single purpose<br>
of clarifying things. It's a shame I had to take it<br>
upon myself, but you know what they say about things<br>
done right. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://lpmuds.net">lpmuds.net</a> site
is intended to be a simple,<br>
easy-to-read description of LP muds. What they are,<br>
where you can get some, and where you can go to <br>
talk about them. None of this fancy calendaring,<br>
plenipotentiary council executive meetings, soup for <br>
the needy, whatever.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It's just a web site with information that I<br>
hope is useful.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you have any suggestions or requests about<br>
what the site should have, please let me know.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On another note, please be aware that Dead Souls<br>
is no longer GPL. For more information, please see<br>
<a href="http://dead-souls.net/articles/copyright.html#23jun06">this
article</a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saquivor has found a neat <a
 href="http://mudsbuilder.sourceforge.net/">creation GUI</a> that he's<br>
adapting for DS use. Keep an eye on the <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/downloads.html">downloads page</a><br>
for a DS template. It should be available soon.<br>
<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148388&amp;package_id=175140&amp;release_id=425833">2.0r26
patch</a> is out. Anyone under that rev is<br>
subject to having their mud compromised by any creator<br>
at any time. Please upgrade <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">NOW</span> if
you haven't already<br>
done so.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As to the issue of Tacitus, please see <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/articles/tacitus.html">this link</a>.<br>

<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As usual, good news and bad news. The good news
first. Tacitus<br>
helped discover a serious security flaw in Dead Souls. Woot!<br>
Congratulations to him for being clever, and thanks for<br>
helping secure DS.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad news is that all versions of DS are
affected, so<br>
you should lock your DS muds (using admintool) and avoid<br>
promoting anyone to a Creator position until the patch<br>
is in place. Hopefully I'll be able to cook something up<br>
this evening.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other bad news is that I found Tacitus trying<br>
to delete log files on the dev Dead Souls mud. I think I<br>
was fortunate that he missed a couple of details in rooting<br>
me, so he failed. However, until I can account for every<br>
free inode with recovery software, the dev mud will<br>
be locked also. Sadface.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For some reason, he also chose to go online and
announce<br>
the details of the flaw without giving me a chance to<br>
address it. This means you are rather exposed, so please<br>
make sure to only allow <span style="font-weight: bold;">very</span>
trusted people to Creator postions.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The <a href="http://dead-souls.net/router.html">I3
router box</a> suffered a storage subsystem failure:<br>
around 8pm the fiber array crapped out and took down the raid volume<br>
the I3 router mud was on. As of 9:20 I3 is back up.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ROXOR. I discussed with Marius the MudOS bundling<br>
question. <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/articles/copyright.html#Marius">Here's the
scoop</a>.<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<a name="06jun06"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">06 June 2006</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am so delighted I could pop any moment. Earlier<br>
today I checked the LPU forums while at a work site, <br>
and was just blown away to see Saquivor had solved<br>
the Windows sockets problem. I was all smiles, and<br>
could barely wait to get to my desk to poke at it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then...sadface. It looked like we solved the
technical<br>
problem of networking, but the next problem involved GPL<br>
code. MinGW used libcrypto that I could not be sure<br>
was not GPL, and the native Win32 binary we made required<br>
that dll.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In a burst of uncharacteristic optimism, I went<br>
about seeing if I could obviate the GPL library in<br>
question, and eventually solved the problem by using<br>
the MudOS built-in MD5 hash auth mechanism. JOY. I<br>
had to get pretty violent with the crypto code, but<br>
it appears to work well, and is far more secure than<br>
the old system.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The only drawback is that new passwords are not
compatible<br>
with old passwords. A driver change will mean some<br>
pain. Fortunately this is an unusual situation.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the interest of cross-platform compatibility I <br>
plan to make the Unix side of the DS distro MD5 auth<br>
also. This will probably happen in the release following<br>
the release I plan to make this evening.<br>
<br>
<br>

<a name="05jun06"></a><span style="font-weight: bold;">05 June 2006</span><br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I spent the entire weekend hacking at MudOS to<br>
try to compile a native Win32 binary. I made a solid<br>
amount of progress, and I'm almost there, but I<br>
need help. <a href="http://dead-souls.net/win32/">Please see if you
can lend a hand</a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I called RedHat bright and early today, to get<br>
in touch with the Cygwin licensing people. Predictably,<br>
I got no straight answers, and I am now officially waiting<br>
for a call beck from a Sales Rep named Mike within<br>
then next two to three business days.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What do you suppose are the chances that a Sales<br>
representative will offer me what I want for free?<br>
----<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He got back to me! And the verdict is:<br>
<br>
<span style="font-style: italic;">" That license costs 25K per
year.&nbsp; I did not mention it as an option
because you mentioned you we looking for a free/low cost option. The
Buyout license doesn't qualify.</span><br style="font-style: italic;">
<span style="font-style: italic;">Mike "<br>
----<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span><span style="font-weight: bold;">CASE CLOSED.</span><span

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The good news is that version 2.0r24 of Dead Souls<br>
is now available for <a
 href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148388">download
from Sourceforge</a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The bad news is that thanks to <a
 href="http://mudconnector.com/discuss/discuss.cgi?mode=MSG2&amp;area=promotions&amp;page=2&amp;message=15212">another
observation<br>
from that member of the mud community</a>, it's come to my<br>
attention that despite my best efforts, the Windows <br>
version of Dead Souls *still* may violate GPL.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am erring on the side of caution and have unbundled<br>
the Windows binary and Cygwin dll's from the Dead Souls<br>
distribution.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I very much hope to have a Windows solution soon,<br>
as a substantial number of the Dead Souls userbase<br>
is on Windows, and presumably there are other folks<br>
interested in using it.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can provide me with instructions on how to<br>
make a non-license-violating MudOS binary, or if<br>
you wish to provide me that binary already compiled,<br>
I'd be delighted to accept that contribution for<br>
consideration.<br>
<br>
Until then, hang tight. We'll figure something out.<br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dead Souls has been removed from the mudmagic file<br>
repository. For details, please read <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/articles/mudmagic.html">this article</a>.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I'm delighted to announce that <a
 href="http://www.mudmagic.com/community/pages/alexander_tau/">Alexander
Tau</a> has been<br>
promoted to a position of substantial admin authority at<br>
LPUniversity, and he has created a <a
 href="http://lpuni.muddomain.net/index.php?option=com_simpleboard&amp;Itemid=47&amp;func=showcat&amp;catid=20">Dead
Souls forum</a> just<br>
for us! W00t! Congratulations, Alex. I'm certain you will<br>
do an excellent job.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've released a new article dealing with <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/articles/copyright.html">Dead Souls<br>
and intellectual property</a>, which tends toward the dry side,<br>
but it addresses issues that Dead Souls admins may have<br>
brought up to them. It's intended as a reference for the<br>
"official" position of Dead Souls on such matters.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You may have noticed a sexy new CSS style format for<br>
some of the pages on the DS site. This is thanks to <br>
<a href="http://www.mudmagic.com/community/pages/kelvin/">Kelvin's</a>
efforts. He took my challenge of "if you don't <br>
like the site's look, do something about it" seriously,<br>
and boy, it sure is easier to read, isn't it? Thank you,<br>
Kelvin. <br>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If there's one thing that bugs me it's news pages for<br>
projects that turn into personal blogs. I can't promise it<br>
won't happen here, but I'll make the effort.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've updated the front page a bit for clarity. It was<br>
getting so *I* couldn't read it. I'm a fan of simple readable<br>
text, and I hope it's easier to get what you need from it.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also added a cute little favicon. <br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As of the current version, 2.0r22, Dead Souls is now
a<br>
single download package...just one file to download whether<br>
you run the Windows version or the UNIX/source code version.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The same is true for the patch. One file to rule
them.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I've been asked by people how they can give back to<br>
the Dead Souls community. Easy. Evangelize. Tell people what<br>
you honestly think of the lib. If someone's in doubt as<br>
to which codebase to choose, point them our way.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you can help me promote the lib, you've done a<br>
good service. The more people use Dead Souls, the stronger<br>
we are as a community. Join the MUD forums and spread the<br>
word, or if that's not your style, lurk until the opportunity<br>
presents itself to give us a good old shameless plug.<br>
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, spend some time on the <a
 href="http://lpuni.muddomain.net/index.php?option=com_simpleboard">LPUniversity
forums</a>.<br>
Create a login, and chat a bit. Liven the place up.<br>
