 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's LPUniversity?</span><br><br>	<a
 href="http://lpuni.muddomain.net/">LPUniversity</a> is an umbrella project intended to embrace and<br>support the continued use of LPC. Among its goals is providing a<br>forum, base of support, and general rally point for folks interested<br>in LPC and LPMuds. <br>	Given the complementary interests of Dead Souls and LPU,<br>Dead Souls is in the process of affiliating with LPU, with the goal<br>of a more formalized alliance down the road. If all goes well, Dead<br>Souls will be a standard platform for LPC training, demos, and so on.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I thought LPUniversity was/had a lib already.</span><br><br>	Originally LPUniversity formed around the premise of <br>a new mudlib that followed in the footsteps of TMI-1 and TMI-2.<br>These muds were designed as training grounds and reference <br>sources for the LPC community.<br>	However, the objectives of LPUniversity the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">project</span><br>are not the same as those of LPUniversity the <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">mudlib</span>. The<br>mudlib named LPUniversity continues to be developed, and<br>is part of the program of LPC advancement that LPUniversity<br>the project is dedicated to.<br><br><br><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">So LPUniversity the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">mudlib</span> and LPUniversity the <span
 style="font-style: italic;">project</span> are</span><br
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">separate. Where does Dead Souls come into the picture?</span><br><br>	The LPUniversity lib is "built from scratch"<br>and is still early in its development cycle. <br>While it is valuable and intended to be highly<br>advanced, it is not quite yet a viable platform for<br>folks to run a production mud on.<br><br>	Dead Souls is a proven platform with dozens of<br>muds already running it. No Dead Souls 2 muds are open<br>to players yet, but the muds using it are busy working<br>toward that goal, with demonstrably well-founded<br>confidence in the current state of the lib being ready<br>for area development.<br><br>	Because Dead Souls is a lib that is "ready for<br>prime time", it is suited to provide the kind of<br>environment the LPUniversity project can use to further<br>its interests.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Good for them. What's in it for Dead Souls?</span><br><br>	As stated elsewhere in Dead Souls FAQs, my<br>primary goals for developing and distributing the<br>Dead Souls mudlib include:<br><br>	1) The fun of it.<br>	2) Getting other people to use it.<br>	3) Sharing new code ideas between DS muds.<br><br>	A successful alliance with LPU provides<br>wider access to the development community through<br>the use of LPU's organizational and promotional<br>resources.<br>	This is valuable because, as the developer<br>of DS, I pretty much have my hands full with<br>coding. Attracting talented developers to pitch<br>in is hard to do, even with all the time in<br>the world.<br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Who's the boss of whom?</span><br><br>	This alliance is best termed as a work in<br>progress at the moment. Nothing is finalized or<br>formalized, because both sides want to ensure that<br>their interests don't face risk.<br><br>	At the moment, Dead Souls and LPUniverity<br>share a proud affiliation. Details and official<br>written words regarding the relationship between<br>the two are not yet cast in stone.<br><span
