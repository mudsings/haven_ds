<span style="font-weight: bold;">THIS PAGE IS INCOMPLETE SO DONT GIMME
NO GUFF<br>
</span><br>
This is&nbsp; a summary of currently-available <a
 href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mudlib">libs</a> whose installation
difficulty level ranges from "easy" to "moderate". The point of this
page is to provide a convenient reference to those interested in trying
them out. These downloads are libs bundled with the driver (with
permission of the authors where required) for your convenience.<br>
<br>
There are LP libs of substantial historical significance that are not
summarized here, such as LPmud 2.4.5 and Nightmare IV. In the case of
2.4.5, the installation process on a modern OS is sufficiently
complicated that getting it to work rates as "hard", and I don't want
to set people up for failure. Nightmare IV, though easy to install and
historically important, has been withdrawn from distribution by the
copyright holder and is therefore not summarized here either. Some
libs, like Foundation, I just haven't gotten to packaging up.<br>
<br>
Other, more obscure libs are omitted due to being so closely related to
the libs here as to be functionally identical. Non-MudOS libs are not
included here simply because I have not yet tested them enough to gauge
their utility and/or recommend them.<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Note about
licensing</span>: Each of these libs comes with its own licensing
information. Do <span style="text-decoration: underline;">not</span>
assume they are public domain, or GPL, or whatever.<br>
<br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">
<span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">Note about
intermud:</span> Most of these libs are designed or preconfigured to
connect to the <a href="http://dead-souls.net/router.html">yatmim
router</a>. Please read the router info and <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/router_rules.html">rules</a> if you plan
on making use of that communication medium. Also, note <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/ds-admin-faq.html#90">this FAQ entry</a>
on intermud security.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls
2</span><br>
Comments: Easy to use, polished, and popular.<br>
Advantages: Works very well right out of the box, thoroughly documented.<br>
Disadvantages: Uses the complex verb system. Function names are
different from older libs.<br>

(Bleeding edge "alpha" development versions are available, but they are
only for the adventurous. You can look <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/alpha/">here</a> for them.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Lima</span><br>
Comments: Easy to use, polished, and popular.<br>
Advantages: Works well right out of the box. Designed by experts
to be extremely advanced.<br>
Disadvantages: Not currently maintained. Not compatible with
add_actions. Perhaps too advanced for beginners.<br>

(Note: This lib distro has <span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">not</span> been
modified by me. You may run into a few snags during installation. The
default router is gjs, not yatmim.)<br>
<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">LPUniversity
Mudlib</span><br>
Comments: Not ready for play.<br>
Advantages: Provides a chance to build a lib from
the ground up without
having to deal much with the driver.<br>
Disadvantages: No longer developed.

<br>
<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Discworld</span><br>
Comments: Well liked, but rarely used.<br>
Advantages: The grotesquely popular <a
 href="http://discworld.atuin.net/lpc/">Discworld MUD</a> uses a
variation of this lib, so it must have something going for it.<br>
Disadvantages: Few adopters. Limited support.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">TMI-2</span><br>
Comments: Rarely used, except by old-timers.<br>
Advantages: It's a solid lib, built by competent coders dedicated to
excellence.<br>
Disadvantages: It's showing its age. Lacks an advanced parser. <br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Merentha</span><br>
Comments: Based on the popular Nightmare 3 lib.<br>
Advantages: Has the "Nightmare feel" and robustness without the
complications of verbs or weird lfun names.<br>
Disadvantages:&nbsp; Limited intermud, and little available support.<br>

<br>
<span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dead Souls
1</span><br>
Comments: Dead Souls 1.1 is nearly identical to Nightmare IV except the
docs are missing.<br>
Advantages: Public domain, so lib licensing is no worry. Simpler than
DS2. <br>
Disadvantages: See "Dead Souls 2" above.&nbsp; DS1 may contain some
bugs&nbsp; that are fixed in DS2.<br>
