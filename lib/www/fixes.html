</div>
<!-- End: Header -->
<p>Obviously, no release of Dead Souls is going to be pefect. However,
not all bugs need a "hotfix". A hotfix is a remediation for a very
important functionality bug or a security exposure. Such important
fixes will be listed on the <a href="http://dead-souls.net/hotfix.html">hotfix
page</a>.<br>
</p>
<p>This page is for the more casual, run-of-the-mill bugfixes that
become available for Dead Souls. You don't *have* to apply them. The
reason for this page is that as time goes on, I expect more and more
minor bugs in 2.1 will be found. I don't want to clutter the hotfix
page with small stuff, because I want people to take very seriously
what gets posted on the hotfix page.<br>

<p><span style="font-weight: bold;">Always back up files before
overwriting them with these fixes.</span><br>
</p>
<p>For Dead Souls <span style="color: red; font-weight: bold;">2.1</span>,
the
following fixes are available:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>There is a peculiar bug in room messages when entering/leaving a
room that mixes up teleport messages and regular movement messages. The
fix is to replace /lib/creator.c and<span style="font-style: italic;"> </span>/lib/player.c
with <a href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/creator.c">this</a>
and <a href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/player.c">this</a> ,
then type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update -r /lib/creator</span>
, then log out and log back in (NOTE: this also fixes a problem with
the <span style="font-style: italic;">return</span> command).</li>
  <li>The shutdown command generates a carry capacity leak and possible
loss of some inventory data in admins. Replace
/secure/cmds/admins/shutdown.c with <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/shutdown.c">this</a> , then
type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update
/secure/cmds/admins/shutdown</span> .</li>
  <li>The reaper daemon destructs shadows every 15 minutes, meaning
that your remote-controlled NPC's will get dested for apparently no
reason. The reap_other() sefun has been fixed to correct this. Copy <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/reaper.c">this</a> over
/secure/sefun/reaper.c , then type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update
/secure/sefun/reaper</span> , then <span style="font-weight: bold;">update
/secure/sefun/sefun</span> . Note that this is a replacement for the
reaper <span style="font-style: italic;">sefun file</span>, and not
the reaper <span style="font-style: italic;">daemon</span>.</li>
  <li>If you go on an economic rampage and delete all the existing
currencies you can, you will run into a problem adding new ones with
admintool, because, well, admintool wasn't coded to handle that
situation. <a href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/admintool.c">This
version is</a>, though. Copy it over /secure/cmds/admins/admintool.c
and then type <span style="font-weight: bold;">update
/secure/cmds/admins/admintool.c </span>. I would suggest however,
first *adding* your new currencies before removing the ones you don't
like, because if you do it this way, admintool can give you some
helpful comparisons of weight, value, and inflation.</li>
  <li>The reload verb has been updated to handle temp objects and
virtual rooms more gracefully. Copy <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/reload.c">this</a> over
/verbs/creators/reload.c and type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update
/verbs/creators/reload.c</span><br>
  </li>
  <li>Non-arches/non-creators have a hard time dropping objects in
rooms set "no teleport". <a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/code/fixes/room.c">This room file</a>
corrects it. Copy it over /lib/std/room.c and type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">reload every room</span> .<br>
  </li>
</ul>
