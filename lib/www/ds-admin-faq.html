 href="#44">44 Where can I get a Dead Souls mud hosted?<br></a><br><a

 href="#54">54 Did you finish the bfd() sefun modification I asked you for last night?<br></a><br><a

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="0"></a>How do I start?</span><br><br>	The first thing to do is follow the <a
 href="ds-inst-faq.html">installation FAQ</a><br>to get Dead Souls installed. Then log in, and start reading<br>the administrator's guide, by typing these commands:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">read index in guide</span><br

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there a MUD somewhere running Dead Souls I can log into?</span><br><br>As a convenience to the curious, I have set up a "demo" mud<br>at rugose.com, port 6666. To connect, either click on<br><a
 href="telnet://rugose.com:6666">this link</a> with your browser, or open a terminal window <br>(or for windows users, Start -&gt; Run ) and <br>type: <span

 style="font-weight: bold;">rugose.com 6666<br><br></span></big><big>When you log in, the system will read your playerfile for<br>a few seconds and then it will turn you into a creator. This<br>is so that you can examine code, try out the QCS, etc. <br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Please note that in the regular, non-demo version of the</span><br

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I like Dead Souls and I want to use it, but I don't want to run a mud.</span><br><br>Being a mud admin is very different from being just a coder<br>or builder, and many people just don't feel like dealing with<br>the hassle of running a mud. <br>	There are a few Dead Souls muds out there that could<br>use help from you. Telnet to the Dead Souls development mud<br>and type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mudlist -m dead</span> to see a list of Dead Souls muds<br>that might be hiring.<br>	You can also just code on the Dead Souls development<br>mud. You're welcome to create as you please, and if your<br>building gets to the point where you'd like it included in<br>the lib, let me know and I'll inspect it for approval.<br>	Please note that anything you code on the Dead Souls<br>development is automatically eligible for inclusion in the<br>standard Dead Souls mudlib distribution, so if you want<br>to prevent your code from being used that way, don't code<br>on my mud.<br><br><br

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">promote them to creator status?</span><br><br>	As admin, you have access to the admintool<br>command. This opens a menu-driven admin system you<br>can use to manage some basic aspects of your new MUD.<br><br>	Everything on admintool can be done with<br>commands, system calls, or file editing, but until<br>you get the hang of all that stuff, admintool<br>is a convenient shortcut. <br>	In this example, you would type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">admintool</span> , <br>then select option <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">3</span>, then option <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">l</span> (that's a lowercase "L").<br><br>	The oldfashioned way, if the new creator<br>were named dude, would be: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">encre dude</span><br><br>	I know. But people like menus, so I made it.<br><br><br

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="4"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What about intermud? How do I talk on that?</span><br><br>	The intermud3 (or i3) network is available<br>to you, and you are probably already connected to it. Type<br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">mudlist</span> to see a list of other muds on the network.<br><br>	By default, the "Dead Souls intermud channel" is<br>enabled for creators. Type: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ds blah blah</span><br>and other Dead Souls muds on the i3 network will see<br>your message like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">You@YourMud <span
 style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">&lt;ds&gt;</span> blah blah</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>	To enable intergossip and intercre, read<br>/doc/README for instructions.<br><br>	Please note that intercre is where you ask coding<br>and technical questions only. Random chatting is not<br>tolerated on that channel. Newbie questions that are<br>Dead Souls specific or that obviously have answers in<br>Dead Souls documentation will meet a hostile reception on <br>intercre.<br><br>	Conversely, intergossip is mostly chat. Please<br>be warned that discussions on intergossip are usually <br>offensive, argumentative, and generally aggressive. <br>	This hostility is <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">especially</span> sharp when you<br>are identified as a "newbie". You will almost certainly<br>be mocked and insulted no matter what you say, but<br>especially if your first messages betray you as <br>ignorant of intergossip standards and traditions. I<br>strongly recommend you lurk on this channel for a few<br>days before saying anything. <br><br>Really, I recommend you avoid the intergossip channel entirely.<br><br><br

 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I talk on intermud but nobody replies. What's up with that?</span><br><br>I3 uses a hub topology. All muds communicating on intermud<br>connect to the router to do so. If that router is down all<br>i3 communication stops, until it comes back up. To check<br>network status, ping Frontiers or Dead Souls. If the<br>ping command gets no answer, i3 is probably down, or<br>your connection to it has been interrupted. Your mud will<br>be aware of this and retry to connect to i3 every<br>fifteen minutes or so.<br><br>There's also the possibility that nobody who wants to<br>chat is listening.<br><br>It's also possible that the Dead Souls I3 router has<br>changed address or port. Visit this page to get the<br>latest connection info:<br><a
 href="http://dead-souls.net/router.html"><br>Dead Souls I3 Router Page</a><br><br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="6"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How did you know my mud started up?</span><br><br>	The same way your mud knows that i3 is up or<br>down. A while ago I noticed that i3 can be very<br>unreliable, and sometimes when it goes down and<br>comes back up, people's muds don't refresh their<br>connection, and they can be off intermud for days<br>without realizing it.<br><br>	I implemented a "keepalive" system which<br>uses the intermud "auth" packets as pings. Every <br>fifteen minutes or so, you mud tries to ping Frontiers<br>and Dead Souls. If it gets a reply from at least one,<br>then it's happy. If neither reply, then your mud <br>alerts the Arch room that intermud is down, and it<br>will reload the intermud daemon every 15 minutes<br>in an attempt to reconnect. Once i3 is back up and<br>you are reconnected, you go back to pinging.<br><br>	This means that Frontiers and Dead Souls<br>get a bunch of pings all the time. When a mud we've<br>never heard of before pings us, we get a message<br>about it, and so we know a new mud is online.<br><br>	If this makes you feel like Big Brother<br>is watching you, you can probably just delete <br>the file /daemon/services/auth.c and then update<br>the file /daemon/services.c without causing harm<br>to your mud. <br><br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's this about a manual on Frontiers?</span><br><br>	It's no longer relevant. All the docs<br>we were making available on Frontiers are now included<br>in Dead Souls, starting from version 1.9r9.<br><br>	In your workroom is a chest. Open the<br>chest and the new Dead Souls Creators Manual is<br>inside. The text files are in /doc/manual .<br><br>	<br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I add limbs to a race?</span><br><br>Edit /secure/cfg/races/&lt;race&gt; and make the changes<br>you want. Then use admintool to remove the race from the<br>races daemon, then add re-add the race. <br><br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="10"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I add a race?</span><br><br>Copy a race in </big><big>/secure/cfg/races/ and edit it.<br>For example:<br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold;">/secure/cfg/races/bear</big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;"> /secure/cfg/races/wampa</span><br><br>Edit the wampa file to reflect what you think a<br>wampa is like. If you want new players to be able<br>to select wampa as their race, make sure the file<br>has this line in it:<br><br>PLAYER_RACE 1<br><br>Make especially sure to change the lines RACE and<br>LANGUAGE. When you're done editing, type:<br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I make my friend an admin?</span><br><br>Use the groups menu in admintool, and select <br>"Modify a group". Select the ASSIST or SECURE group,<br>and enter the names of all the members it should have. If<br>I wanted to make xyzzy an assistant admin, I would<br>make him a creator, then I would edit the<br>ASSIST group and make the contents look like this:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">cratylus:xyzzy<br><br></span>Xyzzy then needs to log out and log back in.<br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="12"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I don't like how the who command output looks! You should change it.</span><br><br>Believe it or not, I actually get requests like this. I also<br>get stuff like "the inventory list should be chronological in<br>order of acquisition." Maybe that's a good idea, but it's<br>your mud, not mine. Make it so for yourself.<br><br>	If there is something broken about the lib itself, such as<br>an insta-death bug or a command that crashes the mud, I am<br>happy and eager to hear about it, so I can implement the fix<br>in the next lib release. If a normal action causes a runtime<br>error or abnormal behavior, I need to know that.<br>	However, if the problem you're having is that the lib,<br>by design, behaves in a way not to your liking, this isn't something<br>I'm likely to "fix" for you. For example, if you want a "<span
 style="font-weight: bold;">who</span>"<br>command with a cooler look, that's up to you to make. You're<br>the one coding a mud, so you need to take it upon yourself to<br>understand the code and modify it to suit your tastes.<br>	Similarly, "orcs are too strong!" or "advancing levels<br>should increase your eyesight" are issues you need to deal<br>with on your own, using the coding skills learned from reading the<br>Creators Manual.<br><br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Most of the file headers have only Descartes's name on them. Did</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">you really develop this lib or did he?</span><br><br>Both. The lib he released in 1997 was his, and so almost every<br>file on it had his name. I've been working on it since, but<br>I am very lazy about headers. I work on lots of files at the<br>same time, and authorship attribution tends to rank very low<br>on my priority list. Therefore, even though a great majority <br>of the files in the lib have been either heavily modified or<br>created by me, my name is on very few.<br><br>I haven't bothered to go back and revise headers either, <br>because, honestly, what a pain in the butt that would be.

 style="font-weight: bold;">go</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">sit</span> and <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">open</span> are verbs. Specifically, verbs<br>are commands that interact with the user's environment. The<br>idea is that <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">throw my first red rock at the green goblin</span><br>should work, and should work the same everywhere on the<br>MUD. Verbs are a source of debate among some people, because<br>to folks accustomed to add_action commands, verbs seem<br>excessively complex.<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">www/</span><br><br>Like the ftp directory, but for the MUD webserver.<br><br><br>	Ok now let's take a quick look at the /secure directory: <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">ls /secure</span> <br>As you can see, /secure seems to have many of the same directories <br>that the root filesystem has. <br>	The reason a /secure directory is needed is that<br>there are files that should not be readable by everyone, and<br>there are files that must be writable only by a few. The MUD security<br>system uses the /secure directory as a means to control access to <br>such files.<br>	For example, the average creator has no business <br>accessing the player data files of other creators or players. Therefore<br>/secure/save/creators and /secure/save/players is offlimits to them.<br><br>	A directory without a counterpart in / is /secure/sefun. This<br>is where simulated external functions reside. <br><br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="47"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are sefuns and efuns?</span><br><br></big><big>	First let me explain that the driver has built-in<br>functions that are available to the mud. For example,<br>type <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">eval return find_player("cratylus")</span> , but replace my name<br>with yours. Your player object pointer will be found and returned<br>to you (more or less. strictly speaking it's more complicated).<br>	The driver provides this function. Because it is "external"<br>to the mudlib, that is, it's in the driver and not the lib, <br>it is called an external function, or more commonly, "efun". The<br>idea is that certain actions you ask the mud to perform are<br>so common that they are made available MUD-wide.<br><br>	Efuns are ridiculously useful and powerful, and because<br>they are in the driver as compiled code, very fast. A near-complete<br>set of efun documentation is available in /doc/efun. <br><br>	However, the driver does not contain every possible<br>MUD-wide function you might want. For example, there is a <br>tell_object() efun, which lets you send a message to an object<br>such as a player. The syntax is something like this:<br><br>tell_object(find_player("cratylus"),"Hi.");<br><br>	Which doesn't look like much, but believe me, this<br>kind of stuff adds up. I wanted to make this simpler, so I<br>used what is called a sefun, or a simulated efun. It is<br>a function that is available lib-wide, but it isn't in<br>the driver. Instead it is provided by the lib itself (the<br>master daemon, specifically). By adding the appropriate code<br>in /secure/sefun/ I have now made available a tell_player() sefun,<br>which works like this:<br><br>tell_player("cratylus","Hi.")<br><br>	This simplification of code will become more obviously<br>useful to you as you get more coding under your belt. Most<br>sefuns are documented in /doc/sefun.<br></big><big><br><br><br

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Whew! Ok now I know where stuff is. What's next?</span><br><br>	You probably want to examine how objects are written.<br>Type <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">goto /domains/town/room/road</span> and wander around town<br>a bit. If you want to see the code for something, for example,<br>the beggar, <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">about beggar</span> should do it, provided the beggar is<br>in the room.<br><br>	To see the filenames of the objects around you,<br>type scan here, or scan me to scan your own inventory. <br><br>	If you've never coded before, this is the hard part.<br>To understand what you're looking at when you run commands like <br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">more /domains/town/weap/orcslayer.c</span> you need to get comfortable<br>with LPC. <br>	The brute force way of doing this is copying stuff<br>and then changing the descriptions, thus making new stuff.<br>This will work, but you'll waste time looking for examples of<br>exactly what you want to do..and you may not find them. <br>	Instead, learning LPC will let you create whatever<br>you want, without relying on templates.<br><br>	This means that now you must read the LPC Basic<br>manual, then the LPC Intermediate manual.

One of my creators just kicked me off my own mud!</span><br><br>One of the virtues of LPC is that it is flexible and powerful.<br>One of the drawbacks of LPC is that it is flexible and powerful.<br><br>	It is not possible to make an LPC mud that is<br>immune to abuse from creators. You just can't. The MudOS<br>function set is just too complex and sophisticated to eliminate<br>every possibility of abuse.<br><br>	You will therefore *always* be vulnerable to things<br>like people coding objects that crash the mud on purpose (I<br>won't detail how that can be done, but anyone with intermediate<br>LPC skill can do it, and utter newbies can even do it with<br>a stupid enough mistake), finding a way to dest admins, or<br>continually updating recursively the /lib filesystem. A<br>jackass will always find a way to expose you to her jackassery.<br><br>	This means that you need to know who is coding on your<br>mud and what they are doing.

You can easily prevent unauthorized<br>access to lib data. See the next section for how this works.<br><br>	What you can't prevent is some dude off the internet<br>you just met and made a creator from wreaking havoc on your <br>mud and creating a nuisance of himself. You have to know who <br>these people are and you have to have a level of trust and <br>confidence in them, otherwise you need to use the <span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><a name="52"></a></span></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is Dead Souls secure?</span><br><br>	The short answer is no, nothing I know of is "secure" in the<br>sense that you don't need to continually pay attention to it. If the<br>question is "Is Dead Souls particularly unsafe to run?" then the<br>answer is no. Just like any other Internet program you use, Dead Souls<br>is not an obvious security risk, so long as it is not used carelessly.<br>And, obviously, games of any kind, including Dead Souls, should never<br>be installed on any mission-critical, national security, public<br>safety, or health care server. <br><br>	Dead Souls security involves two separate spheres:<br><br>1) The binary executable and the system that runs it.<br><br>2) The mudlib and the code that you use and create.<br><br>	The first sphere is probably most important. Presumably<br>you plan to run a mud on a computer that does other things too, <br>and you want to keep those things separate from your mud. The <br>most important thing to do is to avoid running Dead Souls as a<br>privileged user. In the case of Windows, this means that the<br>program should not be run by Administrator or anyone in the<br>Administrator group.<br>	For unix users, this means that the driver should not run<br>under uid 0 (root). <br><br>	The reason for this precaution is that if some genius<br>hacker manages to exploit some unknown weakness in the program, <br>it is better that the process they hack doesn't have full admin<br>privileges to the box.<br>	This caution has little to do with Dead Souls specifically.<br>It is a warning I'd give to anyone planning to run any kind of network<br>server. You should take your own security seriously, and<br>if you do not understand your own security situation, you need to take<br>a step back and ask yourself if running a mud at all is a good idea.<br><br>	Sphere 2 is lib security. In older muds, file and directory <br>privileges were handled by attributes on the files. If a file's<br>user id (UID) matched a user's UID, then that user had full access<br>to it. Such systems often had complex systems that evaluated<br>effective UID (EUID) based on the file's attributes, its parent<br>directory, the user's ID, possibly group id, etc. This is an<br>entirely valid security model, but because of its complexity,<br>it tended to be exploited easily and often. If you don't<br>stay 100% on top of such a system (just like any OS), there's<br>no way to be sure you won't rooted.<br><br>	With stack security, privilege management is much, much<br>easier. A file's privilege is based solely on its location. If<br>a user doesn't have read access to /foo/bar/ then she can't read<br>or modify /foo/bar/file.c. If someone with privs to that location<br>copies the file to somewhere else, then the privs of that new location<br>are in force on the file.<br>	The "stack" part of stack security comes from the mud<br>evaluating the privileges of <span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">all the objects involved in the</span><br
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">access request</span>. If you're unprivileged and you manage to get a <br>privileged object to make the access request for you, the access <br>will fail, because you are unprivileged, and you are still part <br>of the function call stack (i.e., the list of instructions that<br>form a chain between the command and the intended event).<br><br>	Granular (more detailed) modification of user privileges<br>can be done by changing files in /secure/cfg to grant <br>users and groups specific privileges.<br></big><big><br><br><span

It takes me a long time because Dead Souls isn't<br>actually my job, and is not a physical member of my<br>family, so it has to wait its turn sometimes, for my attention.<br>	Sometimes I will get to someone else's code sooner even<br>though I received yours first.

They are<br>basically groups, managed by an arch with admintool, which<br>can be granted privileges not normally enjoyed by mortals.<br>	In the current implementation of Dead Souls, those<br>positions are vestigial.

 style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I would like XYZ and PDQ to happen every time the mud boots</span><br><br></span>The most common way to have this happen is to add<br>your daemon (and typically that's what you'll<br>want to start at boot) to /secure/cfg/preload.cfg .<br>	This will ensure that it gets loaded<br>before the mud accepts any connections. It has the<br>added advantage of being included in the list of daemons<br>that the mud periodically checks and restarts if they<br>have died.<br><br>	If it isn't a daemon, but rather some<br>specific function you want to happen at boot, simply<br>add the relevant code to /secure/daemon/autoexec.c<br><br><br><span

What this means is that some<br>files that are needed in order to load your player <br>object cannot be loaded. It can be any of a very large<br>number of files, which is the problem. Usually this<br>happens if you've been, for example, messing around<br>with player.c, then broke it, and rebooted the mud. Now<br>since player.c can't be loaded, you're locked out.<br>	It could be any of the files loaded by your<br>player object, or other daemon files needed by your<br>login. The only way to narrow down the possible list of<br>files you corrupted is by examining the output of the<br>console (the window where you type the command line<br>to start the mud) and reviewing log/runtime and <br>log/catch for clues.<br>	Once you've found the culprit, either fix it,<br>or replace it with the original version from the<br>Dead Souls distribution package.<br><span

When the basic functionality of a minor<br>version is as bug free as reasonably possible, a new minor version<br>change happens.<br>	Major version number changes are very rare and represent a<br>vast difference from the old major version. Versions 1 and 2 of<br>Dead Souls are so different as to be largely incompatible with each<br>other's code.<br>	As of this writing, the goal of releasing version 2.1 looms.<br>The significance of this milestone is that Dead Souls 2.1 is<br>intended to be the fulfillment of the promise that there was in<br>version 1.1. After the release of Dead Souls 2.1, the focus of<br>development will be in adding major systems and functionality<br>that 1.1 was hoped to have, but never did.<br><br></big><big><a

The new default I3 router for Dead Souls muds is called<br>*yatmim. So far it's been dramatically more reliable than<br>the old intermud.org router, which is known as *gjs.<br>	The advantage to *yatmim is that it is dependable<br>and the bulk of the Dead Souls community (a vital resource for<br>DS-specific technical support) uses that router.<br>	The advantage to *gjs is that many more muds are<br>connected to it, and you can have more opportunity for random<br>chatting and gossiping. Also, the intercre channel on *gjs<br>is an excellent resource for general technical questions.<br>	For more information on switching between routers, type:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">help switchrouter</span><br><br>	If the *yatmim router goes down for more than a<br>few minutes, make sure to check the <a

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Will that be difficult?</span><br><br>	This is, surprisingly, a fairly common question.<br>Basically, the answer is:<br><br>"If you have to ask, then the answer is yes."<br><br>	It's not an impossible task to, say, rewrite<br>combat to be just like the combat you're used to on LeetFooMud.<br>It's totally doable, and not *all* that difficult for<br>an experienced coder.<br><br>	But if you're new to LPC, you need to concentrate<br>on getting the basics down before you put that cart in<br>front of that horse. Let me phrase it like this:<br><br>"If there's any part of the Creator's Manual you don't<br>know and understand, you aren't ready to do lib coding yet."<br><br><br></big><big><a

 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span
 style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">to be able to use QCS in /domains/MistyDragonShireMysts</span><br><br>	The default behavior of QCS is to try to figure out<br>what directory makes most sense to write in. It assumes<br>that it's only going to write into areas you have write<br>permission to. Since your new coder doesn't have write<br>access to /domains/</big><big>MistyDragonShireMysts, QCS instead will<br>write to the next most logical place: her home area directory.<br><br>	This is true even if you use the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">grant</span> command <br>to enhance her access. QCS's authentication mechanism is<br>entirely separate from the grant/access system, which works<br>fine for non-QCS editing.<br><br>	To make your new domain, use the domaincreate command:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">domaincreate MistyDragonShireMysts</span><br><br>	To enable your new coder to use QCS in that domain,<br>use the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">domainadmin</span> command to manage the admins of that<br>domain. A domain may have more than one admin at the same time.<br><br>	For more information on domainadmin, type:<br><span

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How does player voting work?</span><br><br>	The voting system enables players to nominate and<br>vote for class leaders. A Fighter can nominate and vote for<br>his Fighter leader, Mages can vote for a Mage leader, etc.<br>The nomination period usually lasts about a week, then<br>nomination closes and voting begins. Voting ends when<br>an arch enters the voting room (it's in Town Hall) and<br>issues the appropriate command. See the voting room printed<br>material for instructions.<br>	When the voting is ended, the winner becomes<br>council member. The high council is composed of <br>representatives (the leaders) of the classes. What kinds<br>of authority the council should have is entirely up to<br>you and your mud. No default powers are enabled, you'll<br>need to code your own sets of privileges and responsibilities<br>for your councilors.<br>	Because creators have no business meddling in the<br>affairs of mortals, they cannot vote, regardless of their<br>class affiliation.<br><br><br><a
 name="75"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are "estates"?</span><br><br>	Any references to estates in Dead Souls code or<br>documentation are artifacts of pre-1.1 Nightmare code. <br>Estates in the Nightmare lib were player-owned areas,<br>which were granted to players of specific rank, status,<br>etc who could afford to buy the rights to them.<br>	There is currently no estate support in Dead Souls,<br>though it is on the post 2.1 feature list.<br><br><br><a
 name="76"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are "events"?</span><br><br>	Some things should happen regularly. Perhaps<br>log rotation, or backing up some .o files. The events<br>daemon, or EVENTS_D handles this. To add or remove<br>events use the add_event() sefun. For example, to add the<br>log rotation event, I issued this command:<br><br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">eval return add_event("/secure/daemon/log","/secure/daemon/log","RotateLogs",({ }),7200,1)</span><br><br>	Which said: "Every two hours, call the RotateLogs function in the log daemon."<br><br>	To see what events have been scheduled, type:<br><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">events</span><br><br>	To remove an event from the events schedule, find its<br>next runtime, and use it as an argument to the remove_event() sefun,<br>like this:<br><br></big><big><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">events</span><br><br>The following events are pending:<br>1145159511                    RotateLogs     Sun Apr 16 03:51:51 2006 EDT<br><br><span

 style="font-weight: bold;"><br>	Emote data is saved in /save/soul.o<br><br>	You must never, ever, edit an .o file. Period. It<br>is possible to do it without corrupting data, but I do<br>not condone it, I don't recommend it, and if you fux your<br>mud because you did it anyway, I won't support it.<br><br>	If you edit an .o file, and now things don't<br>work, it is your own fault. If you didn't back things up<br>before editing system files, there's nothing anyone can<br>do to retroactively save your data. <br><br><br><a
 name="80"></a><span
 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are .h and .o files? Where are they kept?</span><br><br>	Files with the extension of .h are called header<br>files. They have code or variables that are helpful when<br>creating some things, so that an armor object uses<br>armor_types.h to load some useful information without having<br>to hard code it every time you make a piece of armor.<br>	These global header files are most typically found in<br>/include or /secure/include , although local header files<br>that are specific to a particular directory (such as<br>header files for lib objects) are commonly found in an<br>./include subdirectory of the given directory.<br><br>	Files with an .o extension are object persistence<br>files. They contain data, not code. There are some things<br>that happen in the lib that should persist across<br>reboots, such as races, classes, economy, etc. You could<br>just hard code this stuff, but what if you need to make<br>changes? What if your economy needs to be flexible to <br>accommodate inflation? What if you want to be able to<br>add or remove emotes on the fly? <br>	Persistence files allow you to save data which<br>is subject to manipulation, but which needs to be available<br>in case the mud restarts.<br><br>	Because .o files tend to contain information <br>that is structured and formatted in a very specific way,<br>they should never be edited by hand. They are intended to<br>be loaded and saved by objects like daemons. Monkeying<br>around with the contents of an .o file is an excellent <br>way to damage your mud.<br>	Another reason to avoid it is that even if you<br>make a valid change, it's liable to be overwritten unless<br>you fully understand the daemon that uses that file.<br><br><br><a

I have been reluctant to make any changes to it, <br>because first, it isn't mine, and second, deviations from the<br>current lib are very small.<br><br>	In this particular case, you evidently have noted that<br>the lib uses American spelling for "armor". The original Dead<br>Souls distribution, version 1, and the Nightmare lib used the<br>British spelling of "armour".<br>	Aside from finding it unnecessary and affected, I<br>felt it was distracting and potentially confusing for coders,<br>because it was the only word in the lib spelled this way. There<br>were no instances of "colour" or "honour", etc. Rather than<br>make things uniform by Britishizing them, I made them uniform<br>by Americanizing them.<br>	To this day I don't know the reason for that original<br>spelling. It may be that Descartes intended to make a <br>distinction between, say, an armoury that sells things you<br>wear, and an armory that sells things you wield.<br>	If I remember to, I'll ask him next time we talk.<br><br><br><a

 style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What is "unguarded"?</span><br><br>	Unguarded is the mechanism used to obviate the stack<br>security model. Under some tightly controlled circumstances, it<br>may be desirable to have an object access privileged data, even though<br>an unprivileged object is in the command stack.<br><br>	When the unguarded() sefun is called, the object containing<br>the sefun overrides the security permissions on any other object<br>in the stack, allowing, for example, an unprivileged object <br>to read from your home directory.<br><br>	See <span
