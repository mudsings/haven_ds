Starting a MUD with a lib that is completely new to<br>you can be confusing and discouraging. Hopefully this FAQ will<br>make the experience less difficult.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I start?</span><br><br>	Start by reading the <a href="http://dead-souls.sourceforge.net/ds-faq.html">Dead Souls FAQ</a> for some background<br>on where this lib came from and what you can do with it.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is there a MUD somewhere running Dead Souls I can log into?</span><br><br>As a convenience to the curious, I have set up a "demo" mud<br>at rugose.com, port 6666. To connect, either click on<br><a href="telnet://rugose.com:6666">this link</a> with your browser, or open a terminal window <br>(or for windows users, Start -&gt; Run ) and <br>type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">telnet</span> </big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;">rugose.com 6666<br><br></span></big><big>When you log in, the system will read your playerfile for<br>a few seconds and then it will turn you into a creator. This<br>is so that you can examine code, try out the QCS, etc. <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">Please note that in the regular, non-demo version of the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(153, 0, 0);">mud, people are NOT automatically given creator status. </span><br><br>	On the regular non-demo version of the mud, Only<br>the admin (basically, the first person to log on to the new mud)<br>gets automatic creatorship.<br><br>	After logging in, you will be transported<br>to your workroom. Some useful commands:<br><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">look<br>look at me<br>look at chest<br style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">open chest<br>look in chest<br style="font-weight: bold;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold;">get tricorder from chest</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">read index in handbook</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">read chapter 1 in handbook</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">who</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">stat</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><span style="font-weight: bold;">wiz<br>create new npc generic<br>look at board<br>read 1 on board<br>home<br></span><br></big><big><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I like Dead Souls and I want to use it, but I don't want to run a mud.</span><br><br>Being a mud admin is very different from being just a coder<br>or builder, and many people just don't feel like dealing with<br>the hassle of running a mud. <br>	There are a few Dead Souls muds out there that could<br>use help from you. Telnet to the Dead Souls development mud<br>and type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">mudlist -m dead</span> to see a list of Dead Souls muds<br>that might be hiring.<br>	You can also just code on the Dead Souls development<br>mud. You're welcome to create as you please, and if your<br>building gets to the point where you'd like it included in<br>the lib, let me know and I'll inspect it for approval.<br>	Please note that anything you code on the Dead Souls<br>development is automatically eligible for inclusion in the<br>standard Dead Souls mudlib distribution, so if you want<br>to prevent your code from being used that way, don't code<br>on my mud.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I want to invite my friends to help me code. How do I</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">promote them to creator status?</span><br><br>	As admin, you have access to the admintool<br>command. This opens a menu-driven admin system you<br>can use to manage some basic aspects of your new MUD.<br><br>	Everything on admintool can be done with<br>commands, system calls, or file editing, but until<br>you get the hang of all that stuff, admintool<br>is a convenient shortcut. <br>	In this example, you would type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">admintool</span> , <br>then select option <span style="font-weight: bold;">3</span>, then option <span style="font-weight: bold;">l</span> (that's a lowercase "L").<br><br>	The oldfashioned way, if the new creator<br>were named dude, would be: <span style="font-weight: bold;">encre dude</span><br><br>	I know. But people like menus, so I made it.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What about intermud? How do I talk on that?</span><br><br>	The intermud3 (or i3) network is available<br>to you, and you are probably already connected to it. Type<br><span style="font-weight: bold;">mudlist</span> to see a list of other muds on the network.<br><br>	By default, the "Dead Souls intermud channel" is<br>enabled for creators. Type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">ds blah blah</span><br>and other Dead Souls muds on the i3 network will see<br>your message like this:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">You@YourMud <span style="color: rgb(51, 51, 255);">&lt;ds&gt;</span> blah blah</span><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>	To enable intergossip and intercre, read<br>/doc/README for instructions.<br><br>	Please note that intercre is where you ask coding<br>and technical questions only. Random chatting is not<br>tolerated on that channel. Newbie questions that are<br>Dead Souls specific or that obviously have answers in<br>Dead Souls documentation will meet a hostile reception on <br>intercre.<br><br>	Conversely, intergossip is mostly chat. Please<br>be warned that discussions on intergossip are usually <br>offensive, argumentative, and generally aggressive. <br>	This hostility is <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">especially</span> sharp when you<br>are identified as a "newbie". You will almost certainly<br>be mocked and insulted no matter what you say, but<br>especially if your first messages betray you as <br>ignorant of intergossip standards and traditions. I<br>strongly recommend you lurk on this channel for a few<br>days before saying anything. <br><br>Really, I recommend you avoid the intergossip channel entirely.<br><br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I talk on intermud but nobody replies. What's up with that?</span><br><br>I3 uses a hub topology. All muds communicating on intermud<br>connect to the router to do so. If that router is down all<br>i3 communication stops, until it comes back up. To check<br>network status, ping Frontiers or Dead Souls. If the<br>ping command gets no answer, i3 is probably down, or<br>your connection to it has been interrupted. Your mud will<br>be aware of this and retry to connect to i3 every<br>fifteen minutes or so.<br><br>There's also the possibility that nobody who wants to<br>chat is listening.<br><br>It's also possible that the Dead Souls I3 router has<br>changed address or port. Visit this page to get the<br>latest conenction info:<br><a href="http://dead-souls.net/router.html"><br>Dead Souls I3 Router Page</a><br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How did you know my mud started up?</span><br><br>	The same way your mud knows that i3 is up or<br>down. A while ago I noticed that i3 can be very<br>unreliable, and sometimes when it goes down and<br>comes back up, people's muds don't refresh their<br>connection, and they can be off intermud for days<br>without realizing it.<br><br>	I implemented a "keepalive" system which<br>uses the intermud "auth" packets as pings. Every <br>fifteen minutes or so, you mud tries to ping Frontiers<br>and Dead Souls. If it gets a reply from at least one,<br>then it's happy. If neither reply, then your mud <br>alerts the Arch room that intermud is down, and it<br>will reload the intermud daemon every 15 minutes<br>in an attempt to reconnect. Once i3 is back up and<br>you are reconnected, you go back to pinging.<br><br>	This means that Frontiers and Dead Souls<br>get a bunch of pings all the time. When a mud we've<br>never heard of before pings us, we get a message<br>about it, and so we know a new mud is online.<br><br>	If this makes you feel like Big Brother<br>is watching you, you can probably just delete <br>the file /daemon/services/auth.c and then update<br>the file /daemon/services.c without causing harm<br>to your mud. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I heard there's an I3 router included in Dead Souls.</span><br><br>Please see the <a href="http://dead-souls.net/router.html">router page</a> for details.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's this about a manual on Frontiers?</span><br><br>	It's no longer relevant. All the docs<br>we were making available on Frontiers are now included<br>in Dead Souls, starting from version 1.9r9.<br><br>	In your workroom is a chest. Open the<br>chest and the new Dead Souls Creators Manual is<br>inside. The text files are in /doc/manual .<br><br>	<br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I add limbs to a race?</span><br><br>Edit /secure/cfg/races/&lt;race&gt; and make the changes<br>you want. Then use admintool to remove the race from the<br>races daemon, then add re-add the race. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I add a race?</span><br><br>Copy a race in </big><big>/secure/cfg/races/ and edit it.<br>For example:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">cp </span></big><big style="font-weight: bold;">/secure/cfg/races/bear</big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"> /secure/cfg/races/wampa</span><br><br>Edit the wampa file to reflect what you think a<br>wampa is like. If you want new players to be able<br>to select wampa as their race, make sure the file<br>has this line in it:<br><br>PLAYER_RACE 1<br><br>Make especially sure to change the lines RACE and<br>LANGUAGE. When you're done editing, type:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">addrace wampa</span></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span><br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I make my friend an admin?</span><br><br>Use the groups menu in admintool, and select <br>"Modify a group". Select the ASSIST or SECURE group,<br>and enter the names of all the members it should have. If<br>I wanted to make xyzzy an assistant admin, I would<br>make him a creator, then I would edit the<br>ASSIST group and make the contents look like this:<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">cratylus:xyzzy<br><br></span>Xyzzy then needs to log out and log back in.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I don't like how the who command output looks! How can I change it?</span><br><br>Believe it or not, I actually get questions like this. I also<br>get stuff like "my workroom is broken! fix it!"<br><br>	If there is something broken about the lib itself, such as<br>an insta-death bug or a command that crashes the mud, I am<br>happy and eager to hear about it, so I can implement the fix<br>in the next lib release.<br>	However, if the problem you're having is that the lib,<br>by design, behaves in a way not to your liking, this isn't something<br>I'm likely to "fix" for you. For example, if you want a "<span style="font-weight: bold;">who</span>"<br>command with a cooler look, that's up to you to make. You're<br>the one coding a mud, so you need to take it upon yourself to<br>understand the code and modify it to suit your tastes.<br>	Similarly, "orcs are too strong!" or "advancing levels<br>should increase your eyesight" are issues you need to deal<br>with on your own, using the coding skills learned from reading the<br>Creators Manual.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Can you please make the FAQ easier to read? It's too long and complicated.</span><br><br>I'm a lib coder, not a web designer. Cut me slack. Or, edit it<br>for me and show me how it's done.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Most of the file headers have only Descartes's name on them. Did</span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">you really develop this lib or did he?</span><br><br>Both. The lib he released in 1997 was his, and so almost every<br>file on it had his name. I've been working on it since, but<br>I am very lazy about headers. I work on lots of files at the<br>same time, and authorship attribution tends to rank very low<br>on my priority list. Therefore, even though a great majority <br>of the files in the lib have been either heavily modified or<br>created by me, my name is on very few.<br><br>I haven't bothered to go back and revise headers either, <br>because, honestly, what a pain in the butt that would be. I'm<br>satisfied knowing there's little doubt who has made the many<br>changes on the lib.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How can I change the colors of the channel messages?</span><br><br>The colors are specified in /secure/daemon/chat.c<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">How do I know what other muds use Dead Souls?</span><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>Go to the arch room. Type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">arch<br><br></span>Then type</big><big>: <span style="font-weight: bold;">read screen<br></span></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>This shows a list of muds that used Dead Souls and <br>joined intermud at some point. To see a list that<br>also includes obvious test muds, type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">read printout<br><br></span>See the <a href="http://dead-souls.net/ds-creator-faq.html">creator's FAQ</a> for more intermud command info.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I was hanging out in the Arch room and the loudspeaker went off. WTF?</span><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><br>Your mud receives all sorts of network requests from the <br>intermud network, such are remote who (asking who is logged on),<br>remote finger (info on users), locate (trying to find a user<br>somewhere on i3), etc. Whenever your mud receives such a request,<br>it is announced in the Arch room. Note that these are normal,<br>and do not represent an attempt to undermine your security.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I want to test the intermud channel but I don't want to spam the ds line.</span><br><br>Type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">call me-&gt;AddChannel("ds_test")</span><br>Then type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">ds_test test</span><br><br>The ds_test channel is specifically for communication<br>testing so that ds can remain spam free.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What's this "Network room"?</span><br><br>There is a room below the Arch room called the network room.<br>It is intended to facilitate troubleshooting of network<br>and intermud problems. Unless you're intimately familiar<br>with Dead Souls network code, I suggest avoiding this<br>room, as it is very messy and very noisy.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The web server and FTP server don't work</span><br><br>To enable them at mud boot time, uncomment the "inet" line in<br>/secure/cfg/preload.cfg<br><br>To enable it temporarily, type: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update /secure/daemon/inet</span><br><br>These servers do not use the standard ports. The internet standard<br>http port is 80 and for ftp it is 21. Your mud ftp and web servers<br>do not use these. <br>	Instead, the network port for your web server is 5 less<br>than your mud's port, and the ftp port is 1 less.<br>	This means that if your mud is reached by telnetting<br>to port <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">6666</span>, your ftp server will be at <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">6665</span> and your web server<br>will be at <span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);">6661</span>.<br><br>Please note that the web and ftp server are not supported. They work,<br>but whatever security risk they pose is entirely on you.<br><br><br style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I tried to log in to the FTP server but I can't!</span><br><br>Make sure you use your mud name and mud password, not the<br>username and password of the computer you are on.<br><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I can't do anything with FTP. It just hangs there.</span><br><br>FTP is a funny sort of protocol. If you don't have a direct<br>connection to an FTP server (for example, you are behind a<br>firewall), you have to use PASV (or passive) mode. Unfortunately,<br>at this time, PASV is not implemented in the mud FTP server. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The web server gives me a 404 but I know the directory is there.</span><br><br>Like the FTP server, the web server is a very simple program.<br>It does not do directory listings at all. If you request<br>a directory, and it can't find an "index.html" file, it<br>just errors out.<br><br>It will also barf if a file you try to serve is <br>unusually large.<br><br>Let me make this point one final, excruciatingly clear time:<br><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">If you need a webserver, use apache.</span> The mud www server is available<br>as a convenience, not as a production-quality standards-compliant<br>intarweb server.<br></big><big><br><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I'm using an external FTP server, but the files I transfer<br>become read only!<br><br></span></big><big>You need to make sure that the FTP server you use<br>runs as the same user as the mud driver does, otherwise<br>you'll have permissions conflicts.<br></big><big><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>	</big><big><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;">I moved a command from one directory to another. How do I get the new location recognized?</span><br><br>First, run update on the command in question.<br>then:<br>If it's not a verb: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update /daemon/command</span><br>If it's a verb: <span style="font-weight: bold;">update /daemon/verbs<br><br></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The mudtime is all wrong!</span><br><br>The <span style="font-weight: bold;">mudtime</span> command tells you what time it is in the game, not what time<br>it is in the real world.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">The time of day is all wrong!</span><br><br>If you used <span style="font-weight: bold;">admintool</span> to change your timezone and the time of day is still<br>wrong, you may be using an OS with timekeeping that Dead Souls doesn't<br>understand. If this is so, figure out how many hours off you are, and<br>enter that value into the EXTRA_TIME_OFFSET parameter in /secure/include/config.h<br><br>Also make sure to change your timezone during daylight saving<br>changes. For example, EDT to EST, and vice versa.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What happened to the roommaker and thingmaker?</span><br><br>They produced code that was often incompatible with QCS. They are no<br>longer supported.<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I keep getting 'Connection to address server (localhost 9999) refused.' </span><br><br>This is a harmless error. Dead Souls uses a program called addr_server to<br>try to resolve hostnames. However, hostname resolution is not important<br>to running the mud, so it's not automatically configured. If you run<br>addr_server with a specific port as an argument, and edit mudos.cfg to<br>point to that port for the addr_server, then reboot the mud, then you<br>will probably have hostname resolution in your mud.<br><br>However, not all OS'es handle name resolution the same, so this may not<br>work, even if you do everything exactly right. Either way, it doesn't<br>affect the mud.<br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-weight: bold;"></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Can I charge players a fee for playing on my mud?</span><br><br><big><big style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0);"><span style="font-weight: bold;">NO.</span></big></big> <br><br>Dead Souls uses MudOS, and MudOS has a license that specifically<br>and strictly forbids its use in a commercial way. I don't care how<br>you use the lib, but if you use it with MudOS, you need to comply<br>with MudOS licensing. If you were to port Dead Souls to some other<br>driver that allows commercial use, then you'd be all set.<br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Can people donate money to me for the mud?</span><br><br><big><big><span style="color: rgb(204, 0, 0); font-weight: bold;">Yes.</span></big></big><br style="font-weight: bold;"><br>So long as there is no quid-pro-quo, or anything<br>about the transaction that is legally regarded as "commercial",<br>receiving money from people for the purpose of running the<br>mud is ok. However, I am not a lawyer, so read the MudOS<br>license yourself.<br><br>	You should not try to bend the rules. For<br>example, public television channels often give trinkets to<br>donors as a token of their appreciation. If someone donates<br>money to you for your mud and they get a "thank you gift",<br>this is a quid-pro-quo, or "something for something", and<br>it's not right.<br><br>	This is a MudOS thing, not a Dead Souls thing.<br>If you can't abide by MudOS licensing, just port Dead<br>Souls to some driver that lets you do commercial stuff.<br>Then please tell me how you did it, so I can pass on the<br>leetness to others.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I found a bug.

What's up with that?</span><br><br>True, there is no samurai class, and in fact, as of<br>this writing there is no cleric, acrobat, frombotzer,<br>or basketweaver.<br><br>	The reason for this is that the Dead Souls<br>mudlib distribution isn't intended to be 100% ready for <br>players to show up and start doing quests.<br><br>	What quests there are, what races, classes,<br>areas, objects, rooms, and NPC's you find in the<br>distribution are examples.

There are many mud hosting services<br>out there. I hear good things about <a href="http://www.mudmagic.com/hosting/">Kyndig</a>, but that isn't specific<br>to Dead Souls. A good host will have a high level of service, shell<br>and file transfer access, etc, for which you obviously will need<br>to pay money. <br><br>	There is at least one free mud hosting service I'm<br>aware of, and that's <a href="http://www.frostmud.com/">FrostMud</a>. It's basically a guy and a Linux<br>server with room on it for muds. If you beg adequately, he might<br>let you put your mud on his server for free. I tested it and<br>Dead Souls installed and ran there without any problems. However,<br>he doesn't support anything, you're on your own, and bandwidth is<br>on a "you'll get it when it's there" basis. <br><br>	There's no such thing as a free lunch. If you want<br>a reliably solid, well supported, feature-rich platform for your<br>mud, quit being a cheapskate and cough up the $20/mo. That's<br>like, what, one espresso every couple of days. <br><br>	If you have a DSL or cable modem, and your computer is<br>up all the time, you can just use that, too.

For example, adding an occupational class <br>(like, say, assassin) to the game needs to be done in a<br>precise way in order for it not to break things.

Specifically, verbs<br>are commands that interact with the user's environment. The<br>idea is that <span style="font-weight: bold;">throw my first red rock at the green goblin</span><br>should work, and should work the same everywhere on the<br>MUD. Verbs are a source of debate among some people, because<br>to folks accustomed to add_action commands, verbs seem<br>excessively complex.<br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; color: rgb(0, 102, 0);">www/</span><br><br>Like the ftp directory, but for the MUD webserver.<br><br><br>	Ok now let's take a quick look at the /secure directory: <span style="font-weight: bold;">ls /secure</span> <br>As you can see, /secure seems to have many of the same directories <br>that the root filesystem has. <br>	The reason a /secure directory is needed is that<br>there are files that should not be readable by everyone, and<br>there are files that must be writable only by a few. The MUD security<br>system uses the /secure directory as a means to control access to <br>such files.<br>	For example, the average creator has no business <br>accessing the player data files of other creators or players. Therefore<br>/secure/save/creators and /secure/save/players is offlimits to them.<br><br>	A directory without a counterpart in / is /secure/sefun. This<br>is where simulated external functions reside. <br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">What are sefuns and efuns?</span><br><br></big><big>	First let me explain that the driver has built-in<br>functions that are available to the mud. For example,<br>type <span style="font-weight: bold;">eval return find_player("cratylus")</span> , but replace my name<br>with yours. Your player object pointer will be found and returned<br>to you (more or less. strictly speaking it's more complicated).<br>	The driver provides this function. Because it is "external"<br>to the mudlib, that is, it's in the driver and not the lib, <br>it is called an external function, or more commonly, "efun". The<br>idea is that certain actions you ask the mud to perform are<br>so common that they are made available MUD-wide.<br><br>	Efuns are ridiculously useful and powerful, and because<br>they are in the driver as compiled code, very fast. A near-complete<br>set of efun documentation is available in /doc/efun. <br><br>	However, the driver does not contain every possible<br>MUD-wide function you might want. For example, there is a <br>tell_object() efun, which lets you send a message to an object<br>such as a player. The syntax is something like this:<br><br>tell_object(find_player("cratylus"),"Hi.");<br><br>	Which doesn't look like much, but believe me, this<br>kind of stuff adds up. I wanted to make this simpler, so I<br>used what is called a sefun, or a simulated efun. It is<br>a function that is available lib-wide, but it isn't in<br>the driver. Instead it is provided by the lib itself (the<br>master daemon, specifically). By adding the appropriate code<br>in /secure/sefun/ I have now made available a tell_player() sefun,<br>which works like this:<br><br>tell_player("cratylus","Hi.")<br><br>	This simplification of code will become more obviously<br>useful to you as you get more coding under your belt. Most<br>sefuns are documented in /doc/sefun.<br></big><big><br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Whew! Ok now I know where stuff is. What's next?</span><br><br>	You probably want to examine how objects are written.<br>Type <span style="font-weight: bold;">goto /domains/town/room/road</span> and wander around town<br>a bit. If you want to see the code for something, for example,<br>the beggar, <span style="font-weight: bold;">about beggar</span> should do it, provided the beggar is<br>in the room.<br><br>	To see the filenames of the objects around you,<br>type scan here, or scan me to scan your own inventory. <br><br>	If you've never coded before, this is the hard part.<br>To understand what you're looking at when you run commands like <br><span style="font-weight: bold;">more /domains/town/weap/orcslayer.c</span> you need to get comfortable<br>with LPC. <br>	The brute force way of doing this is copying stuff<br>and then changing the descriptions, thus making new stuff.<br>This will work, but you'll waste time looking for examples of<br>exactly what you want to do..and you may not find them. <br>	Instead, learning LPC will let you create whatever<br>you want, without relying on templates.<br><br>	This means that now you must read the LPC Basic<br>manual, then the LPC Intermediate manual. As admin, your<br>creators will expect you to know what's in there.<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><br></span></span></span></span>	On your person or in the chest in your workroom is<br>the Creators Manual.

But you need to go through the docs<br>soon, ok? In the meantime, read the QCS chapters in the <br>Creators Manual to get you quick-started in the creation <br>process. Remember you need to be holding your Creator <br>Staff in order to access the QCS commands.<br><br>	Other useful tools in your chest are a remote<br>control and a medical tricorder. <br><br></big><big><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Everything is su-u-u-u-p-e-e-r-r-r s-s-l-o-o-o-o-w-w-w</span><br><br>First, make sure you are using the latest available version of<br>Dead Souls (check <a href="http://www.mudmagic.com/codes/download/lpc/mudos/dead_souls">here</a> or <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148388">here</a>). Older versions of Dead Souls<br>are known to have nasty memory leaks.<br><br>Next, see if you have runaway objects. An object can be coded<br>to do really unpleasant stuff like replicate itself over and<br>over until it brings the mud to its knees. Find out how many<br>objects are loaded by typing: <span style="font-weight: bold;">eval return sizeof(objects())</span><br><br>If the count is in the thousands, and only a few people are<br>logged on, you<span style="font-weight: bold;"> </span>may have a runaway. Most often this involves<br>NPC's doing stuff you didn't expect. Reset all loaded rooms<br>with the following command: <br><br><span style="font-weight: bold;">resetall<br><br></span>perhaps followed by a:<span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br>flushobs<br></span><span style="font-weight: bold;"></span><br>If the lag clears up, you found the culprit.

So please try<br>to avoid the rage virus unless you are specifically stress testing<br>your system.<br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Dude! One of my creators just kicked me off my own mud!</span><br><br>One of the virtues of LPC is that it is flexible and powerful.<br>One of the drawbacks of LPC is that it is flexible and powerful.<br><br>	It is not possible to make an LPC mud that is<br>immune to abuse from creators. You just can't. The MudOS<br>function set is just too complex and sophisticated to eliminate<br>every possibility of abuse.<br><br>	You will therefore *always* be vulnerable to things<br>like people coding objects that crash the mud on purpose (I<br>won't detail how that can be done, but anyone with intermediate<br>LPC skill can do it, and utter newbies can even do it with<br>a stupid enough mistake), finding a way to dest admins, or<br>continually updating recursively the /lib filesystem. A<br>jackass will always find a way to expose you to her jackassery.<br><br>	This means that you need to know who is coding on your<br>mud and what they are doing. Your job as an admin is to <br>immediately deal with coders who pose a discipline problem.<br>If they fool you once, shame on them. If they fool you<br>twice..the..they...they shouldn't fool you twice is what I'm<br>saying.<br><br>	This does not mean that Dead Souls is somehow<br>impossible to secure. You can easily prevent unauthorized<br>access to lib data. See the next section for how this works.<br><br>	What you can't prevent is some dude off the internet<br>you just met and made a creator from wreaking havoc on your <br>mud and creating a nuisance of himself. You have to know who <br>these people are and you have to have a level of trust and <br>confidence in them, otherwise you need to use the <span style="font-weight: bold;">decre</span> <br>command.<br><br></big><big><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Is Dead Souls secure?</span><br><br>	The short answer is no, nothing I know of is "secure" in the<br>sense that you don't need to continually pay attention to it. If the<br>question is "Is Dead Souls particularly unsafe to run?" then the<br>answer is no. Just like any other Internet program you use, Dead Souls<br>is not an obvious security risk, so long as it is not used carelessly.<br>And, obviously, games of any kind, including Dead Souls, should never<br>be installed on any mission-critical, national security, public<br>safety, or health care server. <br><br>	Dead Souls security involves two separate spheres:<br><br>1) The binary executable and the system that runs it.<br><br>2) The mudlib and the code that you use and create.<br><br>	The first sphere is probably most important. Presumably<br>you plan to run a mud on a computer that does other things too, <br>and you want to keep those things separate from your mud. The <br>most important thing to do is to avoid running Dead Souls as a<br>privileged user. In the case of Windows, this means that the<br>program should not be run by Administrator or anyone in the<br>Administrator group.<br>	For unix users, this means that the driver should not run<br>under uid 0 (root). <br><br>	The reason for this precaution is that if some genius<br>hacker manages to exploit some unknown weakness in the program, <br>it is better that the process they hack doesn't have full admin<br>privileges to the box.<br>	This caution has little to do with Dead Souls specifically.<br>It is a warning I'd give to anyone planning to run any kind of network<br>server. You should take your own security seriously, and<br>if you do not understand your own security situation, you need to take<br>a step back and ask yourself if running a mud at all is a good idea.<br><br>	Sphere 2 is lib security. In older muds, file and directory <br>privileges were handled by attributes on the files. If a file's<br>user id (UID) matched a user's UID, then that user had full access<br>to it. Such systems often had complex systems that evaluated<br>effective UID (EUID) based on the file's attributes, its parent<br>directory, the user's ID, possibly group id, etc. This is an<br>entirely valid security model, but because of its complexity,<br>it tended to be exploited easily and often. If you don't<br>stay 100% on top of such a system (just like any OS), there's<br>no way to be sure you won't rooted.<br><br>	With stack security, privilege management is much, much<br>easier. A file's privilege is based solely on its location. If<br>a user doesn't have read access to /foo/bar/ then she can't read<br>or modify /foo/bar/file.c. If someone with privs to that location<br>copies the file to somewhere else, then the privs of that new location<br>are in force on the file.<br>	The "stack" part of stack security comes from the mud<br>evaluating the privileges of <span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">all the objects involved in the</span><br style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;"><span style="font-weight: bold; font-style: italic;">access request</span>. If you're unprivileged and you manage to get a <br>privileged object to make the access request for you, the access <br>will fail, because you are unprivileged, and you are still part <br>of the function call stack (i.e., the list of instructions that<br>form a chain between the command and the intended event).<br><br>	Granular (more detailed) modification of user privileges<br>can be done by changing files in /secure/cfg to grant <br>users and groups specific privileges.<br></big><big><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I sent you my code a week ago. Is it in or out?</span><br><br>How long it takes me to review code submissions has nothing<br>to do with what I think of you, your skills, or your<br>code. It takes me a long time because Dead Souls isn't<br>actually my job, and is not a physical member of my<br>family, so it has to wait its turn sometimes, for my attention.<br>	Sometimes I will get to someone else's code sooner even<br>though I received yours first. What can I say. Sometimes<br>I feel like dealing with a particular thing at a particular<br>time.<br><br><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">Did you finish the bfd() sefun modification I asked you for last night?</span><br><br>I'm on the ds line a lot, and generally accommodate people's<br>requests right away if I have time. This makes it seem<br>sometimes like I can turn orders around in minutes or<br>hours, like a short-order cook.<br>	This is an illusion. I do this sometimes<br>for requests that strike my fancy or that are so simple<br>they are not inconvenient, or maybe because I happen to<br>be bored at that moment. But my sometimes doing this<br>doesn't mean folks should expect some sort of prompt<br>turnaround on special requests. <br>	In general, I am not sitting at my desk waiting<br>for code orders. I'm doing something else. If I get to<br>your request right away, then good for you.

They are<br>basically groups, managed by an arch with admintool, which<br>can be granted privileges not normally enjoyed by mortals.<br>	In the current implementation of Dead Souls, those<br>positions are vestigial. You can implement them on your<br>own mud however you please.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br><br><span style="text-decoration: underline;">I would like XYZ and PDQ to happen every time the mud boots</span><br><br></span>The most common way to have this happen is to add<br>your daemon (and typically that's what you'll<br>want to start at boot) to /secure/cfg/preload.cfg .<br>	This will ensure that it gets loaded<br>before the mud accepts any connections. It has the<br>added advantage of being included in the list of daemons<br>that the mud periodically checks and restarts if they<br>have died.<br><br>	If it isn't a daemon, but rather some<br>specific function you want to happen at boot, simply<br>add the relevant code to /secure/daemon/autoexec.c<br><br><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I can't login! I keep getting: "It seems some work is being </span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">done right now, try later."</span><br><br>	This is very bad. What this means is that some<br>files that are needed in order to load your player <br>object cannot be loaded. It can be any of a very large<br>number of files, which is the problem. Usually this<br>happens if you've been, for example, messing around<br>with player.c, then broke it, and rebooted the mud. Now<br>since player.c can't be loaded, you're locked out.<br>	It could be any of the files loaded by your<br>player object, or other daemon files needed by your<br>login. The only way to narrow down the possible list of<br>files you corrupted is by examining the output of the<br>console (the window where you type the command line<br>to start the mud) and reviewing log/runtime and <br>log/catch for clues.<br>	Once you've found the culprit, either fix it,<br>or replace it with the original version from the<br>Dead Souls distribution package.<br><span style="font-weight: bold;"><br></span><br><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">I had a really great idea that revolutionizes ds and you </span><br style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;"><span style="font-weight: bold; text-decoration: underline;">refuse to include it.

When the basic functionality of a minor<br>version is as bug free as reasonably possible, a new minor version<br>change happens.<br>	Major version number changes are very rare and represent a<br>vast difference from the old major version. Versions 1 and 2 of<br>Dead Souls are so different as to be largely incompatible with each<br>other's code.<br>	As of this writing, the goal of releasing version 2.1 looms.<br>The significance of this milestone is that Dead Souls 2.1 is<br>intended to be the fulfillment of the promise that there was in<br>version 1.1. After the release of Dead Souls 2.1, the focus of<br>development will be in adding major systems and functionality<br>that 1.1 was hoped to have, but never did.<br><br></big></pre>
