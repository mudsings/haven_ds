I think that a lot of people used tmi-2 as a starting place to
find more information about lp-muds. So it should stay up in the
air. There is nothing else like tmi-2 out there.

Ah well, I hope things will work out. I'll go to bed and dream about

Ps. Oh Moby, intermud channels and the channel daemon needs to
be integrated as well :)
There are more things that would be nice, but not essential.

Oh,

I am also making Tmi-2 AMCP Compliant, and I will add
an /obj/shells/amcp.c shell.
This will allow it to talk to amcp clients, of which
I'm developing one right now.

   You would think TMI was the federal government with all the 
committees, name calling, and growlings over people feeling their 
territory is being infringed upon.
 
   In my opinion, one of the best things about the TMI-2 mud was the
fact that it served as a clearinghouse of information. People knew that
it was one of the main places to go to get info, or assistance on any variety
of mudlibs or drivers.
 
   I know the main goal of the mud was theoretically the development and
further enhancement of the TMI mudlib. However, this helpful aspect that
seemed to develop by accident there should not be ignored and/or discarded.

   Anyway, I applaud Leto for bringing this site up in an attempt to make
steps forward. I don't think criticisms for calling it this name or that
are justified. He seems to have done the best he could, and the renaming
is an obvious attempt to avoid any conflict.
 
   Well, thanks again Leto. If you can, could you throw a few more
boards around. I miss em :)

The purpose was to keep the Tmi-2 people together, and maybe even
start developing something again :)
But it seems people lost interest completely.
So, basically, it's here so i can answer Tmi-2 questions for people :)

Upgrading is not too bad. It's basically only an error or
6, but they tend to come back a lot, so you'll be fixing it
a few dozen times at least :)

Some versions of gmake don't work properly. cd into the package
directory itself and type 'gmake', then cd back one dir, and do
a 'gmake' to continue.

For the most occuring errors you can check the fixes that were made here.

The build.mudos script checks your system and creates configure.h and
the Makefiles/GNUmakefiles.
If you got a tarred up copy which has already been used, remove the
configure.h file. It probably contains which make you have.
If you start from a really clean distribution, it should build until it
might fail with the packages subdirs. Then manually cd into them
and type either gmake or make (Whatever you spotted mudos using in the
previous make that just failed).
When it's done, cd .. and type make/gmake again to continue. If that
fails, ask Beek at Idea Exchange :)
