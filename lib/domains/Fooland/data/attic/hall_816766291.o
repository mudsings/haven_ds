A few people asked me for the version we run here, so I'll tar one up and put
it on this site for ftp.

Leto

Ps. I made a new archive, but I can't put it up for ftp myself. I've dropped
Armando an email asking to put the file in /pub/mud/tmi2/
hopefully, it's there when you read this.

I don't know. It's a message form the driver I think. There are prob
more details about the error in runtime, catch or log.
I'll have a look at it.

Since we are using same type of driver why not let this driver

Euh. You're not on the mudlist right now, so I can't see what kind of
mud you have. Are you running an Tmi-2 mudlib ?
A mudlist get's sent to you when you connect to the I3 router. Here, the
/adm/daemons/network/I3.c does that for you.

means, simply, that the previous error occured during a call to either
clean_up() or reset().  Pretty simple, eh?  Similar to Error in heartbeat,
etc.
