'clean here' in the adventurer's hall barfed.
hmm... just tried scan -d and sc -d to see what objects are here.
Both of those choked too :-(.  I see an axe, an orc, and the board.
When I tried "sc -d" got an error about /adm/daemons/ref_d not
loading.

passwd doesn't seem to work right. I changed my password earlier
today but it didn't "take" and I had to use my old one to get in.

a number of objects aren't loading. see /log/log.  specifically,
eval, clean, and the aforementioned ref_d.

The newspaper (i.e. newsreader) doesn't allow you to do things like
"open door".  It errors out, saying that /std/rn.c wouldn't load.
