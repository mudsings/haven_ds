This is where real grid rooms should go. They should have the name in the
following format:
x,y.grid.c
where x,y is the grid coordinates of the real room. Any rooms that the
grid server can't find here gets cloned from the virtual room.
You can store other rooms here also if you want to, although we kinda
recommend that you not.
