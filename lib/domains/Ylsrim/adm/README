			 /domains/Ylsrim/adm
	       The Administrative Directory for Ylsrim

This directory contains all files necessary for domain
administration.  The following files are required for any standard
domain, but not for secondary domains or realms:

void.c - The place people go when their environment is destructed
freezer.c - The place people go when they go net-dead
cache.c - The place hidden items go to hide

The access object is used in any realm or domain which is giving out
access which is nonstandard.  This is traditionally handled through
the 'grant' command.
