       This function is exactly like the _c_a_l_l___o_u_t_(_) efun, except
       in that this SimulEfun works across reboots.  This is
       useful for setting up long terms events, such as monthly
       goblin raids or lunar based lycanthropy.  The first
       argument is a string representing the name of the function
       to be called.  The second argument is how long after
       _e_v_e_n_t_(_) is called that the first event should happen.  The
       third and fourth arguments are optional.  If given, the
       third argument is an array of arguments to be passed to
       the function when it is called.  In addition, the fourth
       argument, is a flag.  If given and 1, it flags the event
       to be recurring.  If not give or 0, the event will only
       happen the first time.
