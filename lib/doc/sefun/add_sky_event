       This functions sets the mudlib to call the function you
       specify every time the time of day changes.  With the
       Nightmare Mudlib time system, there are four changes in
       time of day: dawn, morning, twilight, night.  If you call
       _a_d_d___s_k_y___e_v_e_n_t_(_), then any time the time of day changes,
       the function you specified will be called with the time of
       day as an argument.

       add_sky_event((: howl :)) will have the function: void
       howl(string str); get called in your object every change
       in the time of day.  The string argument is the time of
       day, which will be one of dawn, morning, twilight, night.

       In general, this should be called only from _c_r_e_a_t_e_(_) in an
       object.  It definitely should only be called once for each
       function to be called in an object.  Also, it is
       recommended that you _s_e_t___n_o___c_l_e_a_n(1) in any object which
       does have functions set by this function to be called.
