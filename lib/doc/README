		      The Dead Souls Mud Library
		      Released 18 December 2005

UPGRADE NOTE: If you are upgrading from an older version of
Dead Souls, you have to copy your old /secure/cfg/mudos.cfg somewhere
safe first, and then restore it after you upgrade. Alternately
you may just edit the new mudos.cfg to say what the old one said.

	The Frontiers LPC Foundation is pleased to present the
re-release of Dead Souls 2.

	Please read /doc/SUPPORT for details on the supportability
of this software. Note that the Frontiers LPC Foundation does not take
the responsibility for getting you up and running, or fixing bugs.
This code is available to you as-is.

	Some years ago, Descartes @ Nightmare chose to retire his
Nightmare mudlib from distribution. Despite various disputes over
the years, this embargo has stood quite firm. Yet some folks felt
that it was a fine lib, and many were sorry to see it go.

	This mudlib is based on that old warhorse. It is entirely
free from those copyright problems, and can be shared.

	We felt that too many substandard libs were starting to
pop up, and that there was a need to bring back some of the old
LPC magic. In accordance with this wish to cater to the elite, we have
disabled some intermud channels by default. To enable them, all you
need to do is add them to yourself with these commands:
call me->AddChannel("intergossip")   
call me->AddChannel("intercre")

	If you want to contribute to the Dead Souls Lib Resurrection
project, please visit Frontiers MUD and leave some mudmail for
Cratylus. You can also request to sign up as a lib developer at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dead-souls/

	The latest available files will be at http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148388 so check often.

	Please review /doc/old/README for more historical background.

	Have fun!
