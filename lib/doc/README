		      The Dead Souls Mud Library
		    Re-Released 12 September 2005

	The Frontiers LPC Foundation is pleased to present the
re-release of Dead Souls, after many years of neglect. This
distribution is updated with the latest current version of MudOS,
and has had various essential lib fixes applied.

	Please read /doc/SUPPORT for details on the supportability
of this software. Note that the Frontiers LPC Foundation does not take
the responsibility for getting you up and running, or fixing bugs.
This code is available to you as-is.

	Some years ago, Descartes @ Nightmare chose to retire his
Nightmare mudlib from distribution. Despite various disputes over
the years, this embargo has stood quite firm. Yet some folks felt
that, however personally unpleasant he may be, Descartes had overseen
the development of a fine lib, and many were sorry to see it go.

	This mudlib is based on that old warhorse. It is entirely
free from copyright problems, and can be freely shared.

	We felt that too many substandard libs were starting to
pop up, and that there was a need to bring back some of the old
LPC magic. In accordance with this wish to cater to the elite, we have
disabled intermud channels by default. To enable them, all you
need to do is change your MUD's name, by editing the mudos.cfg file.	

	If you want to contribute to the Dead Souls Lib Resurrection
project, please visit Frontiers MUD and leave some mudmail for
Cratylus. You can also request to sign up as a lib developer at
http://sourceforge.net/projects/dead-souls/

	Please review /doc/old/README for more historical background.

	Have fun!
