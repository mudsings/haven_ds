chapter 2 "Player Management"


Snooping:
--------

    One of the most powerful and most easily abused tools
in your administrative arsenal is the snoop command. When
you "snoop <person>", you get to see everything they
say and do.
    Players usually find this intrusive and objectionable,
and it is ethically shaky to do this without their 
knowledge and consent. The only circumstances under which
snooping is unambiguously ethical are:

* Snooping one of your own test characters.

* Snooping a player (with their consent) for the purposes of
troubleshooting a bug.

* Snooping a player (without their consent) to investigate
a legitimate suspicion of cheating.

    Secretly snooping people for your personal amusement is
pretty much just flat wrong. 

    By default, only admins can snoop. Admins are players who
are members of one or both of the groups SECURE and ASSIST. 
    An assistant admin *can* snoop a full admin. When this
occurs, the full admin receives the message that he or she is being
snooped.
    When an assistant admin is snooped by full admin, they
do not receive this message.
