I'd like to thank the following people for their help, witting or
otherwise, in making the new release of Dead Souls possible:

Sine qua non: Descartes, the legion of MudOS developers, and
              all those coders who toiled at Nightmare.

Direct conributors: Haderach and his clever code and inspiration, Duuk
              and his willingness to let me poke through his lib and
	      filch code. Great thanks to Marajin for his direct and
	      substantial contribution to the Windows port.

Appreciation of: Jayren, Kaylus, Arianrhod, Nosmo, and Alensin for their
              thoughtful comments and suggestions.

Also: Xyzzy He Is Cool
