chapter 36 "QCS: Modifying weapons"

    Remember that the QCS chapters are supposed to be read in 
sequence. This is important because as we progress, I will not make
explanations about directives and concepts explained previously.

    Weapons are different from rooms and NPC's in that they can
be handled, sold, thrown, etc. They are manipulable objects. As such,
we will see new directives:

create weapon hammer

    You may be familiar with this example from the example webpage.

about hammer


    Like a room and unlike an NPC, you can also modify the SetItems on
manipulable objects like weapons, so you could do something like this:

modify hammer item

shaft

handle

.

A thick, reinforced steel shaft with leather bands for a strong grip.
