chapter 5 "Communication"

    There are many ways to communicate with other players. If
you're in the same room as your intended listener, you can just 
use the "say" command, like this:

say hi, crat

    If the message is secret, you can "whisper":

whisper to cratylus are you idle?

    If you want to say something that everyone in the mud can
hear, use the "shout" command (at the cost of a lot of stamina):

shout hey crat, wheredya go?

    Or, if it's an important secret and the target is not in the 
same room as you, you can use the magical "tell" command:

tell cratylus are you mad at me or something?


    There are also special communication lines on the mud that are
class or role-specific. For example, if you type:

newbie does anyone know what's up with cratylus?

    All people who are tuned into the newbie line will get
your message. To see what lines are available to you, type:

lines

    To enable or disable a line, just type the name of it with no message.

    To see a brief history of the past few messages on a line (in
this case, the newbie line), type:

hist newbie


    Spamming lines is rude and probably dangerous to your character, so 
be sure you comply with your mud's rules on lines. 


    Your mud may be on the intermud network. To find out, type the
command:

mudlist

    If a list of muds comes up, you know your mud is probably
on the intermud3 communication network. Dead Souls by default restricts
players from access to intermud channels, but you can "tell" to
players on other muds, if you want. If you think your friend Xyzzy
is online on a mud on intermud3, you can issue this command:

locate xyzzy

    If he's logged into a mud on i3, you will get something like:

Xyzzy was just located on Frontiers. (idle 00:03:17) [status: inactive]

    You can then tell to him:

tell xyzzy@frontiers dude, what's the deal with crat lately?
