How to get a second instance of your mud running if the
new port is 8888 and your name is "you":

- Get the mud running the normal way. Create an admin char, etc.
- Once it's up, copy a new mudos.cfg into bin/ . Call it something
  like mudos.8888
- Change the mud name in mudos.8888
- Change the port in mudos.8888 to 8888
- Change the global include file in mudos.8888 so that instead of <global.h>
  it has <global.8888>
- Go to /lib/secure/include/ and copy global.h to global.8888
- Edit global.8888 so that the defines for NETWORK_H and CONFIG_H look like:

#define CONFIG_H "/secure/include/config.8888"
#define NETWORK_H "/secure/include/network.8888"
#define ROOMS_H "/secure/include/rooms.8888"

- Copy network.h to network.8888
- Copy config.h to config.8888
- Copy rooms.h to rooms.8888
- Edit config.8888 and set ENABLE_INSTANCES to 1
- Go to /secure/save/creators/y
- Copy you.o to you.8888.o (or whatever-your-name-is.8888.o)
- Go back to bin/ and type: ./driver ./mudos.8888
- Enjoy!
