The prawn are a large, bipedal race bearing a strong resemblance to insects. The most commonly encountered prawn are soldier drones: extremely strong but unwise, unintelligent, and uncharismatic. Prawn also tend to change little over time as they gain experience: their stats improve very slowly.

Due to the severe challenges of prawn psychology and physiology, only very experienced players should choose prawn as a race.
