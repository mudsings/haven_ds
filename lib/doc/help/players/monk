Monks are the defenders of the good and holy.  Generally monotheistic,
they congregate in monasteries dedicated to a particular form of
deistic worship.  Their faith is the major source of their power.  In
addition to using their faith to bring about magic, they also spend
their time concentrating in hand-to-hand combat.

Monks are great as a balanced class for those who love both role-play
and hack-n-slash.  With respect to role-playing, monks are extremely
dedicated to their faith, taking great risks to do battle with evil.
They absolutely will not associated with kataans.  For hack-n-slash,
monks make great hand-to-hand warriors.
