  it hasn't been working for a while, and it was only noticed by
  a bugtester, it's going away until post-2.1

  inet in /secure/cfg/preload.cfg. They are UNSUPPORTED, and if they ruin
  your life, it's not my problem. System security is on you.
- Added valid_link() to master.c so that link() efun works. An interactive,
  privileged, nonforced object is required in the previous_object() stack
  to avoid abuse. Do NOT use this functionality unless you know EXACTLY
  what you're doing. It probably doesn't work the way you think it does.
  Be especially careful not to link privileged files to directories that
  unprivileged users have write access to. Windows users should just 
  forget they read any of this.

  should be dead at long last.
- Golems can have their composition specified. As an example, the combat
  dummy is now a wood golem.

  menagerie of sample npc's for testing.

- Fixed lib/std/book.c bug that failed horribly if there was a hidden
  file in the text source directory.
- Extensive code cleanup of unused variables.
- Miscellaneous tweaks to sample domain.
- Added tighter restriction to "no teleport" property in rooms.
- Miscellaneous fixes of verb code.
- Modified wrap() sefun to output truncated text rather than just
  error out when buffer overflows.
- Added arch command.
- Added EXTRA_TIME_OFFSET parameter to /secure/include/config.h to
  accommodate OS'es with peculiar timekeeping.
- Changed local_options to avoid excessive warning messages in /log/errors.
  This is only useful if doing a new install of Dead Souls, or
  if you copy local_options from the full distribution and recompile
  the driver. For the Windows version, all that is needed is to
  copy the new driver.exe over the old one, if you're doing an upgrade.
- Rescue login feature added. If when you try to log in, everything
  goes to hell, try logging in adding "_rescue" to your name, which
  in my case is: cratylus_rescue
- For admins, eval now writes the temp file to /secure, to avoid 
  annoying /realms dir permission conflicts.
- Cleaned up goto and dest command ugliness.
- Modified reload command and reload() sefun not to perform recursive
  updates by default. This should speed up QCS response time and cut
  down on mud-wide lag.
- Added some directives to QCS.
