to_int - convert a float or buffer to an int

int to_int( float | buffer x );

If `x' is a float, the to_int() call returns the number of type `int' that is 
equivalent to `x' (with any decimal stripped off).  If `x' is a buffer, the
call returns the integer (in network-byte-order) that is embedded in the
buffer.
