            Documentation and Support for Dead Souls


	Due to copyright problems, this mudlib distribution
does not include any of the original Nightmare IV or Nightmare V
lib documentation files. 

	Naturally this is an inconvenience, and perhaps in
the future Descartes will explicitly permit the redistribution
of those docs.

	In the meantime, you can access this documentation
by logging onto Frontiers MUD and reading the Creator's Manual
that's available for a small fee at the Campus Bookstore.

	As of this writing, Frontiers is at
frontiers.wcsu.ctstateu.edu port 5050, or if that is inaccessible
you may try rugose.com 5050.

	For your convenience, a telnet room has been added to your
mud that can help you connect to us. Just enter the telnet room
north of the default start room, and type: connect

	You may ask questions of creators there, but
don't be offended if they are more interested in building
their mud than helping you with yours.

	However, the driver documentation files do not
have this problem, and you can find them in the /docs directory.
