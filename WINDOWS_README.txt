It's been brought to my attention that despite
my best efforts, the Windows version of Dead Souls *still*
may violate GPL. 

I am erring on the side of caution and have unbundled
the Windows binary and Cygwin dll's from the Dead Souls
distribution.

I very much hope to have a Windows solution soon,
as a substantial amount of the Dead Souls userbase
is on Windows, and presumably there are other folks
interested in using it.

If you can provide me with instructions on how to
make a non-license-violating MudOS binary, or if
you wish to provide me that binary already compiled,
I'd be delighted to accept that contribution for
consideration.

Until then, hang tight. We'll figure something out.
