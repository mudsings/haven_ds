	The Frontiers LPC Foundation is pleased to present the
release of Dead Souls 2.

	Please read /doc/SUPPORT for details on the supportability
of this software. Note that I do not take
the responsibility for getting you up and running, or fixing bugs.
This code is available to you as-is.

	Some years ago, Descartes @ Nightmare chose to retire his
Nightmare mudlib from distribution. Despite various disputes over
the years, this embargo has stood quite firm. Yet some folks felt
that it was a fine lib, and many were sorry to see it go.

	This mudlib is based on that old warhorse. It is entirely
free from those licensing problems, and can be shared.

	If you want to contribute to the Dead Souls Lib Resurrection
project, please email me at cratylus@users.sourceforge.net

	The latest available files will be at 
http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=148388 

	Please review /doc/old/README for more historical background.

	Have fun!
