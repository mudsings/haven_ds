Extras directory

- local_options.*  On at least one system, the local_options version
  included in ds1.9r8 and up causes driver compilation to fail. This 
  older local_options file is included as a courtesy for those who
  run into this problem. From the extras directory, just type:
  cp local_options.* ../v22.2b14/local_options

- restore_cfg If you screw up your mudos.cfg file, you can use this to
  get it back.
