- restore_cfg If you screw up your mudos.cfg file, you can use this to
  get it back.

- To rebuild the driver with maximum warning verbosity, use the 
  noisy.local_options provided here.

- For those who want to use Cygwin to compile their own Win32
  binary, you can use mudos_cygwin.diff to patch the 22.2b14 source
  you download from mudos.org. Do *NOT* try to patch the mudos
  source included in this distribution with that file. Download
  from mudos.org, and patch that.
