Whatever the law says, so it applies here.

Note that the changes to the original Dead Souls release 
of 1998 are copyrighted by me, Bill Sanchez, and 
are NOT GPL. Understanding what that means and
due compliance with applicable laws is left as an
exercise to the reader.

MudOS is being packaged with the lib pursuant to 
standard mud practice. Please note that MudOS is
copyrighted, and should we be asked to 
stop distributing it by the copyright holder, 
we will be obligated to do so.

For explicit details on Dead Souls and MudOS 
bundled distribution, please see:

A few details, for the license fetishists:

* It's ok to run a mud with this. Modify it as you
wish, and do what people normally associate with
"running a mud." You can change anything about the
lib after you download it. It's your mud game. I don't
care what you do with it. But you're encouraged
to share your work with me. 

* It's probably ok to fork development and make
your own lib distribution. Just check with me
first so we can get things straight.

* I expect this to be enough information so you
know what you can and can't do lawfully with
this software. I can't stand licensing discussion,
and will not enter into a debate with you about 
what copyright means. I will not answer any
further questions on the subject. This document
is the final word on the matter. If in doubt,
refer to your local laws and regulations concerning
intellectual property.
