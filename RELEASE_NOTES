---- 2.0r12 ---
- Fixed function conflict that made "scan -i" fail.
- Tightened up "get" lib code.

  like backpacks and such, also added it to QCS.

---- 2.0r11 ---
- Added findobs sefun and findobj command.
- Fixed "no steal" item property so thieves can't steal such things.
- Android corpses and severed limbs now decay in their own special way.
- Fixed up the sample flu and cold so they don't permanently affect a 
  a player's stats. Added a very nasty rage virus.
- Ftpd and httpd now work (Thanks to Duuk @ Haven). To enable them, uncomment
  inet in /secure/cfg/preload.cfg. They are UNSUPPORTED, and if they ruin
  your life, it's not my problem. System security is on you.
- Added valid_link() to master.c so that link() efun works. An interactive,
  privileged, nonforced object is required in the previous_object() stack
  to avoid abuse. Do NOT use this functionality unless you know EXACTLY
  what you're doing. It probably doesn't work the way you think it does.
  Be especially careful not to link privileged files to directories that
  unprivileged users have write access to.
- Verbified dest command. Peculiar "desting of nonexistent things" bug
  should be dead at long last.
- Golems can have their composition specified. As an example, the combat
  dummy is now a wood golem.
- Creatures born without limbs are now able to fight while in their
  natural prone position. Creatures who used to have limbs and no longer
  do have more limited options.
- SetUnique() now does what common sense requires.

---- 2.0r10 ---

  be undead without quite realizing it.

- Miscellaneous fixes, tweak, etc.
- Fixed channels bug that changed lognames if someone was listening
  to a channel. Now both log.

  to enable certain characteristics of their new body.

- Fixed multiple bugs in lighting system.
- Added light meter to creators' chest.

- Added numerous new directives to QCS.
- Added lib object check and NoModify checks to QCS verbs.
- Fixed object manipulation: creatures without prehensile appendages can 
  no longer accept or manipulate objects. If a creator somehow
  manages to lose both hands they can use the "heal" command to fully
  restore themselves.
- Fixed a variety of body related issues with races, created a
  menagerie of sample npc's for testing.
- Fixed stealing system, added thief class.

  messages fixed, etc).

- Modified wrap() sefun to output truncated text rather than just
  error out when buffer overflows.
- Added arch command.
- Added EXTRA_TIME_OFFSET parameter to /secure/include/config.h to
  accommodate OS'es with peculiar timekeeping.
- Changed local_options to avoid exessive warning messages in /log/errors.
  This is only useful if doing a new install of Dead Souls, or
  if you copy local_options from the full distribution and recompile
  the driver. For the Windows version, all that is needed is to
  copy the new driver.exe over the old one, if you're doing an upgrade.
- Rescue login feature added. If when you try to log in, everything
  goes to hell, try logging in adding "_rescue" to your name, which
  in my case is: cratylus_rescue
- For admins, eval now writes the temp file to /secure, to avoid 
  annoying /realms dir permission conflicts.
- Cleaned up goto and dest command ugliness.
- Modified reload command and reload() sefun not to perform recursive
  updates by default. This should speed up QCS response time and cut
  down on mud-wide lag.

  a convenience to those who've gotten used to it. Instead of
  the roommaker, use the create command, then the modify command
  to adjust the new room to your preferences.
- The thingmaker is now obsolete and has been removed. On-line
  object making and editing is done using the new commands: create,
